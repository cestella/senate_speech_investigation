Voinovich (R-Ohio) today released the following statement on the House message to accompany H.R.1586, the legislative vehicle for Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) aid to states and teacher education: Todays aid package would only help state and local governments cope with the current revenue shortfall in the short term, failing to fix the long-term budget issues. This approach will also impede the presidents fiscal commission from providing the comprehensive tax reform recommendations needed to guide the United States back to the path of economic prosperity."},

Mr. President, other business organizations like the Chamber of Commerce and Financial Services Roundtable support the bill because they know it contains important tax provisions, strengthen existing SBA programs, and help our economy. It is worth remembering the Senate moved to the bill on June 29, then abandoned it repeatedly to vote on unemployment benefits multiple times, financial regulation, supplemental appropriations, executive nominations, the DISCLOSE Act, and the teacher bailout, which took us into the August recess."},

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), who served as Tulsas mayor from 1978 to 1984, today expressed disappointment with event organizers who for the second year have taken word Christmas out of the Christmas Parade of Lights. I have participated virtually every year for decades in Tulsas Christmas Parade of Lights, riding horseback as my children and grandchildren watched, Inhofe said. I am hopeful that the good people of Tulsa and the citys leadership will demand a correction to this shameful attempt to take Christ, the true reason for our celebration, out of the parades title."},

This is unacceptable and frankly, it is unconscionable to ask the hard-working taxpayers of this country to foot the bill for hundreds of billions of dollars of bailouts when Congress and the Administration cannot even come up with a plan for Fannie and Freddie within two and a half years of taking them over. Senator Sessions introduced an amendment, that I cosponsored, to offer hard-working American families a reprieve from footing another financial sector bailout, while also discouraging these companies from continuing the irresponsible practices that got them into trouble in the first place."},

The National Mediation Board issued a final rule change on May 11, 2010, that has affected companies under the jurisdiction of the Railway Labor Act by allowing union elections to be decided by only a majority of workers who cast ballots, reducing the number of votes it takes for a union to organize permanently. The Supreme Court has upheld the "majority rule" twice, and the National Mediation Board previously rejected requests to change it four times under both Democratic and Republican administrations."},

Though we still have a long way to go, it is clear that efforts to fight the common threat posed to the Hemisphere by drug traffickers and organized crime are showing some positive results.

That is why last year 21 of our colleagues - Democrats and Republicans - joined me in cosponsoring my rescissions bill S.907, the Budget Enforcement and Legislative Tools Act, which I believe is a much more tempered approach to fixing this problem. I look forward to working with you, Senator Feingold, and our colleagues to pass the President's expedited rescission proposal - or something similar to it -- and to begin to restore a measure of fiscal sanity in the government of our nation."},
