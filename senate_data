A tax ruling by the IRS last year disallowed breast pumps and other breastfeeding supplies as medical deductions, thus also excluding them as permissible expenses under flexible health spending accounts. Rep. Maloney and Sen. Merkley secured a provision in health care reforms passed earlier this year that employers of hourly workers are required to provide breastfeeding employees with reasonable break time and a private, non-bathroom place to express breast milk during the workday, up until the childs first birthday."},

As you know, the agreement would require American taxpayers to borrow over $50 billion in order to give, on average, $100,000 in additional annual tax cuts to people earning over $1 million per year. Improving Social Securitys finances is, in our opinion, a more important national priority than directing tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer money to a relative handful of families."},

These are funds that we do not have, being dedicated to an industry that is economically viable and less deserving than many other energy stimulus efforts.

Over two years after its invasion, Russia not only continues to occupy 20 percent of Georgias sovereign territory, it is building military bases there, permitting the ethnic cleansing of Georgians in South Ossetia, and denying access to humanitarian missions  all in violation of Russias obligations under the ceasefire agreement negotiated by President Sarkozy.

In presenting Senator Conrad with the award, the Concord Coalition called him a true deficit hawk, who has made fiscal responsibility a hallmark of his tenure on the Budget Committee, as both Ranking Member and now Chairman. The group further said that his positions on the debt and deficit are very much in tune with ours. It is time to end the partisan gridlock and find a bipartisan way forward. The Concord Coalition created the Paul E. Tsongas Economic Patriot Award to honor those who have demonstrated a commitment to fiscal and generational responsibility. The award has been given to individuals in business, government and politics who have made lasting contributions to Americas economic health. Some of the past winners of the award include: President Bill Clinton, Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, U.S. Comptroller General David Walker, and Senator Judd Gregg (R-NH)."},
