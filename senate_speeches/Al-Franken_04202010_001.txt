Fixing our broken system helps Minnesota in many of the ways we need the most. I want to talk a little bit about the numerous benefits that kick in during the first year. We’ll start to close the gap in Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage by providing eligible seniors with a $250 rebate this year, closing the “donut hole” entirely by 2020.  And beginning January 1st, 747,000 Minnesota seniors on Medicare will get a free check up every year.  

And the new health reform law looks out for small businesses in a big way.  This year, up to 72,400 Minnesota small businesses will gain access to tax credits to help make it more affordable to cover their workers.

Minnesota has always been a leader in making sure that our children are taken care of, and one of the first things health reform does is improve access to care for kids.  In Minnesota 506,870 sons and daughters will be able to stay on their parents’ insurance plans until they are 26, which is a big deal for those graduating from college in this tough job market. And we’ll stop allowing health insurance companies to subject children to pre-existing condition exclusions, which means if your child is diagnosed with diabetes, epilepsy, or any other condition, an insurance company won’t be able to deny coverage.  So you can start a small business, change jobs, or move your family to a different town – without worrying that you won’t be able to find coverage for your child.  

Another big win for Minnesotans that takes place this year is the elimination of lifetime coverage caps.  From now on, you cannot be told by your insurance company that you’ve hit your lifetime limit, leaving you holding the bill.  This is a big deal for Minnesotans who are battling cancer or have costly chronic diseases like diabetes.   

Minnesota can also access federal Medicaid funds right away to cover low-income adults without children, who have historically been covered at state expense. This will bring in hundreds of millions of new dollars for Minnesota, providing meaningful fiscal relief at a time when the state is really struggling.

We call this health insurance reform for a reason, that’s because it goes a long way towards improving accountability for health insurance companies. I was proud of a provision I created that requires insurers to put more of your insurance premium dollars towards actual health care services, not CEO salaries, advertising, or profits.  We’ll also require insurance premium increases to be reviewed and justified.  These measures will provide more consumer protection than ever before.

All of the benefits I’ve mentioned so far are available within the first year, but there are even more to come.

In the years ahead, we’ll begin to tackle one of the most flawed elements of the current system: Medicare reimbursement. Our current system punishes high-quality Minnesota providers, like the Mayo Clinic, by paying them less because they provide efficient, lower-cost care. The new law includes something I fought for with my colleagues Senator Klobuchar and Congresswoman McCollum to reward value – not volume – in Medicare.  This is good for Minnesota and will help slow costs nationwide.

And in 2014, low-income Minnesotans will be eligible for tax credits to help cover premiums when they purchase health coverage through a new “health insurance exchange,” a user-friendly marketplace for health insurance.  Health plans will have to cover mental health and substance abuse services.  Insurance companies will also be prohibited from excluding pre-existing conditions or charging you more because of your health history, or because you’re a woman.  There will be support and incentives to help us stay healthy and prevent disease, which is good for quality of life but also saves money in the long-run.  And the list goes on.

Unfortunately, many people aren’t aware of all the victories we’ve achieved. They’ve been scared by the misinformation that was used to try to defeat reform.  For example, there’s an important point that’s been lost in the overblown rhetoric these past months – this bill is not a government takeover of health care.  In fact, it’s an expansion of private coverage, with millions more Americans covered by private insurance companies.  And while small businesses will receive tax credits if they cover their workers, businesses with less than 50 employees will not face any penalties if they don’t provide coverage.  And although it’s true that individuals will be required to have coverage beginning in 2014, it’s important to understand that there will be new, affordable options in the new health insurance exchange.  I believe Minnesotans’ support for the new law will continue to grow as we share accurate information and dispel myths about what health reforms means for our state.  

Our new law is a major victory for Minnesota families.  I’m proud to represent Minnesota at this historic time and to have contributed to improving the health of this country for our kids and future generations.
