Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar announced today that the bipartisan Asian Carp Prevention and Control Act has passed Congress and will be sent to the President to be signed into law. Klobuchar is a cosponsor of this bill.  The bill would prohibit the importation and transportation of Asian carp, an invasive species that has created problems throughout the lower Mississippi and Missouri Rivers.

“Minnesotans take great pride in our lakes and rivers, and there’s no place for Asian carp in any of them,” Klobuchar said. “This invasive species not only kills off our native fish populations, but it also has harmful effects on commercial and recreational fishing, tourism, and boating – this bill will help stop the spread of this dangerous species.”
  
Asian carp are known for disrupting local ecosystems due to their large size, destructive eating habits, and rapid rate of reproduction. Asian carp also threaten to negatively impact the Great Lakes’ $7.5-billion fishing industry and the 800,000 jobs it supports.

Klobuchar serves on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and has pressed for both short- and long-term solutions to stop the spread of Asian carp.
