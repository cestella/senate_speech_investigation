Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar announced today that the Senate passed bipartisan legislation that she pushed for to prevent drug companies from price-gouging children’s hospitals for drugs used to treat rare medical conditions, called “orphan drugs.” In recent months drug companies have notified hospitals that they will no longer follow a program that requires drug manufacturers to offer discounts to a variety of health care providers for approximately 350 drugs. The legislation that Klobuchar supported, the Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010, provided a permanent fix and ensures children’s clinics and other providers will continue to receive discounted treatments.

“This bipartisan and commonsense fix makes sure drug companies can’t deny essential treatments to kids,” said Klobuchar. “We simply could not allow drug companies to exploit life-saving drugs and engage in price gouging at the expense of Minnesota hospitals, clinics, and families.”

Orphan drugs account for a large share of pharmacy costs for hospitals and clinics that treat Minnesota’s sickest children with the most complex health care needs.  Without the legislation, Minnesota hospitals and clinics stood to lose millions of dollars, jeopardizing the care they are able to provide.

The passage of this legislation means children who are being treated for cancer, need organ transplants, or have chronic conditions like cystic fibrosis will continue to have access to these life-saving drugs.  This drug discount program will allow clinics and hospitals to reach more eligible patients and provide more comprehensive services.

Senator Klobuchar has been a leader on children’s health issues and is chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Children’s Health.
