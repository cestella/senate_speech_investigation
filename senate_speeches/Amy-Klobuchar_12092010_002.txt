Washington, D.C. – Yesterday, the U.S. Senate convicted U.S. District Court Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., on four articles of impeachment – removing him from office and barring him from again seeking public office. The Senate convicted Judge Porteous on all counts and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar voted to convict him on all counts. Klobuchar was one of 12 senators appointed to hear evidence and issue a report as part of the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee.

Only 15 federal judges have ever been impeached by the House of Representatives, and only 11 previous impeachment trials have been completed in the 221-year history of the Senate.

“The Constitution gives the Senate the sole power to try all impeachments, and this was the rare day when we were called upon to exercise that power,” Klobuchar said. “The purpose of impeachment is to protect the integrity of our government and public confidence in our judiciary.”

Porteous was accused by the House of Representatives of having committed “high crimes and misdemeanors,” including repeatedly accepting cash gifts totaling $20,000 from the lawyers involved in a case he presided over; allowing two individuals to manipulate bail amounts in exchange for providing him with expensive meals, a trip to Las Vegas and car repairs, using a false name in his bankruptcy filing while concealing debts and gambling losses; and making false statements during his confirmation process.

“When I looked at the evidence, I determined that the judge’s behavior unquestionably undermined public trust in the justice system, and that is why I voted to convict him on each article of impeachment,” Klobuchar said.

Klobuchar served on the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee, which oversaw its first judicial impeachment trial in more than 20 years. Other senators on the committee include: Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Jim DeMint (R-SC), Tom Udall (D-NM), John Barrasso (R-WY), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Ted Kaufman (D-DE), Mike Johanns (R-NE), and Jim Risch (R-ID).

The House of Representatives has the sole power to impeach federal judges, but the Senate has the sole power to try impeachment cases.  Judges and other public officials can only be convicted in impeachment proceedings with a two-thirds vote of the entire Senate.
