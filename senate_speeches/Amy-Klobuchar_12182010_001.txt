Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar released the following statement today after legislation to repeal the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy passed the U.S. Senate, and was sent to the President to be signed into law:

“Today a bipartisan group of Senators stood up with our military leaders to repeal the 1993 Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Policy.  I’ve always believed the commitment of our top military leaders is critical to successfully implementing the repeal of this policy.  Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Michael Mullen, and other leaders in our Armed Services have testified in support of the repeal and today the Senate acted to make this happen.”
