Washington, DC – The U.S. Senate confirmed Susan Richard Nelson to be a judge on the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota following U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar’s recommendation. Klobuchar recommended Nelson to the President in November 2009, following consultation with a Judicial Selection Committee.

“Susan Nelson has the judicial temperament, personal integrity, and keen legal mind that are prerequisites for excellent judges,” said Klobuchar. “It is an honor to have Susan as our next federal judge – she knows the law, she knows the federal court, and she knows Minnesota.”

Nelson has served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge in Minnesota since June 2000. In this position, she serves as a judicial officer appointed by the judges of the federal court district and conducts a wide range of judicial proceedings to expedite the disposition of civil and criminal caseloads in the court.  She has a reputation for being thorough and prepared, and she possesses a unique ability to bring parties together to resolve legal disputes.

Prior to her appointment as a magistrate judge, Nelson was a trial lawyer in both state and federal courts for 22 years.  Nelson will replace Judge James Rosenbaum, who took senior status in October 2009 and stepped down from the federal bench this past August.

Susan Richard Nelson was recommended by Klobuchar in November of 2009 and officially nominated by the President in April of 2010.  Earlier this year in May, Klobuchar introduced Nelson at a Judiciary Committee hearing and spoke on the Senate floor to push for her swift confirmation.

Klobuchar, a former prosecutor, serves on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee which oversees the confirmation of federal judges.
