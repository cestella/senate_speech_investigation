U.S. Senators Arlen Specter and Bob Casey announced today that the USDA has approved a $4,878,500 loan for water system improvements in the Borough of Portage Municipal Authority in Cambria County, PA. The funding is contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. 

Funding announced today for this project will improve rural water system infrastructure and seeks to protect public health, create construction jobs, and ensure the environmental safety of the community. Funding of individual recipients is contingent upon their meeting the terms of the loan or grant agreement. 

“I am pleased to see stimulus funds at work for improvements to water system infrastructure in the Borough of Portage Municipal Authority,” said Senator Specter. “This investment will ensure the delivery of safe drinking water for the community, act as a boon to the local job market and reduce pollution for a more sustainable environment.” 

“Maintaining our water system infrastructure is necessary to ensure that Pennsylvanians have access to safe drinking water,” said Senator Casey. “It is good to see Recovery Act funds being put to use in the Borough of Portage to help protect public health, create construction jobs and ensure the environmental safety of the community.” 

This announcement is one of 34 projects to help improve water quality in 24 states. To date, USDA has announced $2.9 billion in Recovery Act funds for 788 water and environmental projects.
