U.S. Senator Arlen Specter (D-PA) issued the following statement regarding the passing of former Alaska Senator Ted Stevens: 
“The nation has lost an icon of statesmanship and a stalwart public servant. Senator Stevens was an exemplary leader in the United States Senate, a champion for military and defense issues, a proud veteran, and friend of mine. His work on behalf of all Alaskans was unparalleled in the United States Senate, and his passion for this country will be forever remembered. Joan and I are deeply saddened by this news and offer our most sincere condolences to Catherine and the Stevens family.”
