U.S. Senators Bob Casey (D-PA) and Arlen Specter (D-PA) today announced that the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has awarded $784,000 to Wireless Neighborhoods to develop broadband infrastructure in Southwestern Pennsylvania. The funding is available through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). 

Funding for Wireless Neighborhoods will help provide enhanced Internet access and online tools to predominately underserved communities in Pittsburgh. The project plans to deploy 160 new public workstations at four new computer centers in the city. 

“I am pleased that this funding is coming to Pennsylvania to expand access to broadband,” said Senator Casey. “This project will not only benefit consumers, it can also spur economic development and create jobs.” 

“Access to the internet is critical in today’s world and these investments will help bridge the digital divide so that all Pennsylvanians can be connected to a solid communications infrastructure,” Senator Specter said. “This funding is great news for Pennsylvania as it will spur investments in technology and provide long-term economic growth to the region.” 

The funding announced today is part of a $1.8 billion investment touching 37 states. The aim of the funding is to expand broadband infrastructure and bring jobs and economic opportunity to rural communities.
