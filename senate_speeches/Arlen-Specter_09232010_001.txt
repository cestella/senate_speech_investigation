Today, U.S. Senator Arlen Specter issued the following statement regarding today’s auction for the Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News: 

“As the participants enter today’s auction for the Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily News, I urge all of them to renounce deep cuts and layoffs. Such actions would not only be devastating to the region but also to the quality of journalism. It is my hope that the new owners protect these jobs and preserve these reputable papers.”
