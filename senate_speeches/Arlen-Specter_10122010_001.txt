U.S. Senator Arlen Specter (D-PA) today issued the following statement regarding the passing of U.S. District Court Judge Marvin Katz: 

“Judge Katz was an extraordinary lawyer and a great jurist. We were best friends since college days, debated Oxford University together, attended law school together, and were later law partners. I never knew a lawyer who matched his analytical skills and brilliance. He will be sorely missed by family, friends, and the people of this community whom he served.”
