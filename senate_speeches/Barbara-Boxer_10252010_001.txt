U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today lauded U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood’s announcement that more than $902 million in new federal funding will be awarded to California to advance the engineering, design and construction of high-speed rail throughout the state.
Senator Boxer said, “This is a great announcement for California that will create jobs at a time that we really need them. California voters demonstrated they support high-speed rail by approving nearly $10 billion in state bonds for the system in 2008. This federal investment will boost California’s economy, reduce air pollution and congestion on our roads, and help us build a cleaner and more efficient transportation system to move people all across our state.”  

Federal funds will be distributed to 18 California high-speed rail transportation projects, with $715 million going to the Central Valley. Nationwide, $2.5 billion in Department of Transportation appropriations will be allocated to high-speed rail projects. The grants will be funded through the FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act and the FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act.  

California’s high-speed rail system, which is the most advanced in the country, previously received $2.25 billion in federal funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which Senator Boxer supported. In 2008, California voters approved $9.95 billion in state bonds for high-speed rail development across the state.
