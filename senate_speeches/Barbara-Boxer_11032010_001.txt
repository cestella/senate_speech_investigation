U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) today lauded the announcement by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that California companies will be awarded $281 million in federal tax credits and grants to invest in the development of new treatments and cures for diseases such as Parkinson’s, cancer, Lymphoma and others.

Senator Boxer said, “These investments will help small biotechnology businesses in California get the capital they need to create jobs and develop the next generation of life-saving treatments and cures.”

The $1 billion Therapeutic Discovery Tax Credit program will help hundreds of small California biotechnology companies and nearly 3,000 companies nationwide produce new cost-saving therapies, create jobs and advance efforts to treat and ultimately cure cancer. This tax credit and grant program was created by the Affordable Care Act signed into law earlier this year, which Senator Boxer supported.

The credit covers up to 50 percent of the cost of qualifying research and is only available to firms with fewer than 250 employees in order to ensure that this investment is targeted toward small biotech businesses, which have struggled to get access to capital to expand and hire. The program gives these businesses the option to receive a grant instead of a tax credit so small businesses that are not yet profitable can also participate.
