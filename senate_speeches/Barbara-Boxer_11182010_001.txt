U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) joined a number of her colleagues today at a press conference calling for the Senate to immediately repeal the military’s discriminatory “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. The following are excerpts of the Senator’s remarks:  

I was in the Senate when this policy went into effect, and I was proud at the time to offer an amendment to take it out of the bill, so I’ve been working on this for a while. And I am very proud that Senator Reid announced that we’re going to have another vote here.  

As we look at our nation, what we realize is our nation always moves toward equality. That’s been our history. We’ve got to move toward equality - or we lose the essence of our nation. And this road is about moving toward equality.  

This is a no-brainer. People are fighting for our country. They’re heroes. They’re stars. And for absolutely no reason they find themselves tossed out of the military. No reason, other than something that has nothing to do with their ability to protect this nation. 

America is behind us repealing this. I’ve seen numbers that range from 75 percent for repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” to 78 percent support (for repeal), so we are speaking for the majority—a clear majority of the people.  

We now stand – with this rule – with countries like Iran, North Korea and Pakistan in banning gays and lesbians from military service. Now, our brave young men and women fight alongside allies like Australia, the United Kingdom and others who allow gays and lesbians to serve (openly). Let’s not stand with Pakistan and with North Korea and Iran. It’s just wrong.  

This is the moment to move our country forward.
