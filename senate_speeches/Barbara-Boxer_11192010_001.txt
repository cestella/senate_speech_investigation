U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) urged the Transportation Security Administration to expand upon the TSA’s decision today to exempt certain airline pilots from the most intrusive security screenings by developing a “trusted traveler” program for fully vetted, law-abiding U.S. airline passengers.

The full text of Senator Boxer’s letter to TSA Administrator John Pistole is below:

November 19, 2010

The Honorable John Pistole
Administrator
Transportation Security Administration
601 South 12th Street
Arlington, VA 20598

Dear Administrator Pistole:

As you know, many Americans have expressed concerns about new intrusive security measures at our nation’s airports.

As a Senator who has authored laws to protect our cockpits and increase the number of air marshals on long haul flights, I know that the security and safety of the flying public must be our number one priority. However, I also believe that we can adhere to this principle while implementing common-sense policies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our security policies.

That is why I was pleased to hear TSA’s announcement today that it is taking steps to ensure that U.S. air carrier pilots will not need to go through intrusive screening procedures on a regular basis. This is a welcome step and I now ask that you develop a similar trusted traveler program for fully vetted, law-abiding U.S. airline passengers.

Thank you for your consideration. I will be calling you early next week to discuss the details of a plan.
