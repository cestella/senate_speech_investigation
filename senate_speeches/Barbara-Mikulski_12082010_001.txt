WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) issued the following statement today about the foiled bomb plot in Baltimore County:
“Congratulations to the men and women of the FBI's Baltimore field office. I’m so proud of their work in foiling a reported bomb plot in Baltimore County. This is the second time in as many weeks the FBI has stopped a terrorist plot to harm Americans here at home. I’m deeply troubled that an attack was being planned on a military recruitment center to harm the young men and women who sacrifice so much for our country. But I’m grateful for the FBI’s professionalism and skill in keeping us safe.”
Senator Mikulski is the chairwoman of the Commerce, Justice and Science Subcommittee, which funds the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
