WASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ U.S. Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today gave her support to the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act, but said she has reservations about its impact on Social Security.
 
"This agreement has serious flaws," Senator Mikulski said. "Yet, if Congress doesn't extend unemployment insurance and tax breaks for the middle class, our fragile economy could slip backwards. This is the only realizable option we have right now to create jobs, stabilize our economy and ensure there is a safety net for people who have lost their jobs."
 
The legislation will help 100 million middle-class families by preventing a tax increase of more than $2,000 for the typical family that would go into effect January 1. It prevents more than 21 million families from coming under the Alternative Minimum Tax. And it extends the Earned Income Tax Credit and the tuition tax credit.
 
Additionally, this agreement extends unemployment benefits through the end of 2011. It will help more than 75,000 families in Maryland put food on the table, pay the rent and pay the energy bills.
 
"This money goes straight back into our economy while putting more money in the pockets of millions of Americans who are facing the worst job market in a quarter century," Senator Mikulski said. "This gives them the time they need to get back on their feet, while we get the economy back on track."
 
Still, Senator Mikulski said she is concerned about the cut in the Social Security payroll tax.
 
"The authors of this deal say there will be no impact on the solvency of Social Security and that the Social Security trust fund will be reimbursed for the lost revenue from the payroll tax. But this could have dangerous consequences for Social Security," Senator Mikulski said. "I will fight to make sure temporary tax cuts are not turned into means to undermine Social Security."
