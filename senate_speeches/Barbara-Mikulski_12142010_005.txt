WASHINGTON, D.C. – Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) announced that the Omnibus Appropriations Act filed today in the Senate provides increased funding for agencies focused on innovation, workforce development and science, including the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the science and economic bureaus within the Department of Commerce. The act includes $34 billion for these agencies – $1.4 billion more than last year’s enacted level.
Chairwoman Mikulski has been fighting for several years for federal investments that strengthen America’s innovation economy, to ensure our national research programs keep America competitive in the global arena. In addition to investing in science, the CJS provisions of the Omnibus make sure the American workforce has the high-tech skills it needs to thrive in the innovation economy and that American manufacturers can leverage new technology to create new jobs at home while expanding U.S. markets overseas.
INVESTING IN SCIENCE, RESEARCH AND EDUCATION
Chairwoman Mikulski has delivered on her pledge to provide critical investments in scientific research and education to improve America’s competitiveness as outlined in the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education and Science (COMPETES) Act. 
“We are creating the building blocks that we need to develop an innovation workforce in America. Our nation is in an amazing race – the race for discovery and new knowledge, the race to remain competitive,” Chairwoman Mikulski said. “I will continue to work for a federal investment to support innovation and create jobs that save lives, create prosperity and protect the homeland.”
The CJS provisions of the Omnibus include:
$6.1 billion for NSF research and research facilities and $900 million for education and training programs, focusing on building a next generation workforce in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, including $45 million to train Federal cyber security professionals.
$877 million for NIST, which is $21 million above the FY 2010 level, will support highly leveraged basic research that will contribute to the development of new innovative products and processes. 
$35.6 million for NOAA education programs, which is $15.9 million above the President’s request, and includes $10 million for education grants and $14 million for educational partnership programs with minority-serving institutions.
Chairwoman Mikulski has included in this year’s spending bill a significant federal investment in research and technology development critical to our understanding and prediction of changes in the Earth’s climate and oceans.  
“With so many Americans living and working near the coasts and so many communities affected each year by severe weather, I will continue to fight for a federal investment in Earth observation,” Chairwoman Mikulski said. “This is green science that helps families and creates green jobs.”
Chairwoman Mikulski has included funding for multiple initiatives, including:
$1.8 billion for NASA earth science to fund critical satellite missions, $380 million more than last year’s level, for earth science missions that measure our ice sheets, climate and atmosphere so we can better predict changes to our planet. It also includes $641 million for NASA to explore how the sun affects the Earth to help predict and provide warnings about events that can knock out our communications and power grids, like solar flares.
$3.3 billion for NOAA weather and climate prediction, which are important early warning tools to help save lives and money, including $1.8 billion for NOAA’s weather satellites and $234 million for climate research for more accurate climate models and better drought forecasts.
$2.3 billion for NOAA ocean programs, which includes over $456 million for fisheries management activities, and $33 million for the Integrated Ocean Observing System.
 
PROMOTING INNOVATION-FRIENDLY GOVERNMENT
As Congress works to promote innovation and discovery, Chairwoman Mikulski has provided critical funding to ensure that the government has the resources it needs to protect inventions and intellectual property, and enforce trade agreements. 
“We must protect the intellectual property of our inventors, who deserve timely access to patent protections and strong enforcement of those protections,” Chairwoman Mikulski said. 
The CJS provisions of the Omnibus include:
$2.3 billion for the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to protect the intellectual property of inventors. This provides PTO full access to user fees to help reduce the patent backlog. 
$504 million for the International Trade Administration (ITA), which includes funding for the National Export Initiative and to hire more Foreign Commercial Service officers who work to expand overseas markets for U.S. businesses.
 
DEVELOPING LOCAL WORKFORCES AND ECONOMIES
Chairwoman Mikulski supports the American workforce, especially small and mid-sized businesses. Keeping American communities and workers competitive in the world economy means creating new jobs locally, investing in economic development projects and leveraging science and technology breakthroughs as the engines for economic growth. 
“We need to make the innovation economy real for local communities. That’s why the federal checkbook must support programs that develop more businesses and create more jobs here at home,” Chairwoman Mikulski said.
The CJS provisions of the Omnibus include:
$317 million for the Economic Development Administration (EDA) including $34.8 million for creating and supporting new economic districts throughout the Nation, and $228 million for competitive grant opportunities to invest in local economies and job incubators.
$125 million for NIST’s Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) directly linking federal research with manufacturers to solve problems, increase productivity, improve economic competitiveness, and enhance technological capabilities.
$32 million for Minority Business Development Agency helping minority-owned businesses grow by providing access to financing and advice on business planning and business management.
