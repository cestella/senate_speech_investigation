 December 2, 2010 – Today, Nebraska’s Senator Ben Nelson issued this statement concerning the report issued by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform:
“The members of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform are to be commended for outlining solutions to our debt problems not in generalities but with specific, tough proposals," said Senator Nelson. "While not everyone will support all of them, and I don’t back all of them, I’m committed to working to slash the federal debt that jeopardizes Nebraska’s and all of America’s future. They’ve spotlighted one of three critical issues I’ve pushed for in the lame duck session: jobs, taxes and debt reduction. One down, two to go.
“Nebraskans tell me they want a serious debate about debt reduction that the commission’s report should trigger, and with good reason. Just a decade ago, the federal debt was $5.6 trillion, but after borrowing for two wars, for federal spending and to combat a major economic crisis, it’s now is nearly $14 trillion, and rising fast.
“Without action by Congress and the administration, the consequences could be dire: China and other countries that currently own much of our debt might become unwilling or unable to continue financing on our terms, forcing drastic steps to keep our economy afloat. The debt crisis we’ve seen in Europe could explode here. Hardship could spread across America and we could slip into becoming a second tier nation, no longer the leader of the free world.
“My hope is, as we move toward taking action before that disaster strikes, that we’ll see more accurate information and less misleading commentary from both proponents and opponents of various solutions. The severity of our debt problem demands no less.”
