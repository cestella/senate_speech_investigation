 December 3, 2010 – Today, Nebraska’s Senator Ben Nelson issued this statement addressing tax cut votes scheduled to occur in the U.S. Senate on Saturday, December 4.
“Nebraskans concerned about jobs, taxes and debt reduction should be partly pleased that, finally, the Senate will vote Saturday on two plans addressing major tax cuts that expire December 31st,” Senator Nelson said. “I say partly because the truth is it’s widely believed that neither has the votes to pass. Unfortunately, Washington gamesmanship is to blame.
“The votes will likely divide largely along party lines. While I intend to vote for the plan that helps the most taxpayers, when the dust settles Saturday we’ll probably see no tax cuts for any Americans.
“Once that reality sinks in, Nebraskans will want both Republicans and Democrats to get serious and work out a tax cut bill that can pass soon. If nothing is done, hundreds of thousands of Nebraskans and millions of Americans will be hit with sizable income, capital gains and estate tax hikes right after the holidays. Those tax hikes will affect families, small businesses and push our fragile economy backward at the worst time. Friday’s news that unemployment in America is up from 9.6 percent to 9.8 percent makes that crystal clear.
“I’ll continue pushing for extending all of the expiring tax cuts for a period time to provide the greatest opportunity to stimulate investment, economic growth and get our economy back on track. That clarity and certainty also will generate revenues that should be used to pay down the federal debt, which is crucial for America’s long-term economic stability.”
