December 3, 2010 – Today, the Senate Armed Services Committee confirmed the nomination of General C. Robert Kehler to be the next commander of U.S. Strategic Command, located at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska.
Nebraska’s Senator Ben Nelson, a member of the committee who supported Kehler’s nomination, said that he expects the full Senate will confirm Kehler, paving the way for him to assume command of U.S. Strategic Command. The current commander, Gen. Kevin Chilton, is retiring from that post.
“General Kehler is eminently qualified to lead America’s strategic forces, having led U.S. Space Command and as former deputy commander at STRATCOM. I’m pleased the Armed Services Committee strongly endorsed his nomination and I expect he’ll be confirmed soon by the full Senate,” Senator Nelson said. “A smooth transition is crucial for STRATCOM, which is preparing to build a new headquarters to help meet its 21st Century mission overseeing global security for America worldwide, in space and cyberspace.
“General Chilton has provided outstanding leadership at STRATCOM, which will continue when General Kehler takes over soon.”
