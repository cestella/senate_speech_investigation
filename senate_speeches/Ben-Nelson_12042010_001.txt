December 4, 2010 – Today, Nebraska’s Senator Ben Nelson issued this statement after the Senate voted on two proposals addressing a series of tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 that are set to expire at the end of the year. Both failed to receive the 60 votes required under Senate rules to advance.
“While the first two tax cut votes failed thanks to Washington gamesmanship, the Senate has finally begun working on one of Nebraskans’ top priorities, keeping taxes low,” said Senator Nelson. “Now, Nebraskans want both Republicans and Democrats to work out a bipartisan plan that will extend all, or nearly all, of the income and other tax cuts that expire December 31st. Nebraskans know that such a tax cut plan will shore up jobs and stimulate economic growth to get our fragile economy back on track.
“In today’s votes, I opposed the first plan because it would raise taxes for a number of small businesses, penalizing the best job creators in our economy. I supported the second plan because it extended the tax cuts for the most taxpayers in Nebraska and nationwide.
“Before the votes, I told colleagues that if either plan passed I would fight to make sure that any revenue generated by ending tax cuts for some Americans would got not for new government spending but to pay down the nearly $14 trillion debt. Debt reduction is essential for all Americans’ economic future, and for our nation to remain the leader of the free world.”
“I’ll continue pushing for extending all of the tax cuts to provide certainty, clarity and continuity we need to get our economy going strong again. I hope the Senate will come together soon to pass major tax cuts. With Friday’s disappointing news that unemployment jumped to 9.8 percent, Congress must act now, not next year or our economy could drift backward.”
