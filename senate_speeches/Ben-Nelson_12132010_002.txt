December 13, 2010 – Today, Nebraska’s Senator Ben Nelson issued this statement after voting to move to final debate and vote on the bipartisan Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010.
“I don’t believe Nebraskans want anyone’s taxes to go up while our economy remains so shaky, but that will automatically happen to nearly every taxpayer if Congress doesn’t act soon,” said Senator Nelson. “I support the bipartisan tax cut plan because it will provide the clarity and certainty Nebraska families and businesses need to pay their bills, meet payrolls, hire new employees and help pull our economy out of the ditch.
“The tax cut plan extends income tax cuts for millions of Americans that expire on December 31st. It cuts payroll taxes for all workers, encourages business investment and job creation in such areas as renewable energy and continues unemployment benefits for out-of-work Americans.
“This tax cut plan may not be the best possible solution. But it is the best solution possible. It’s notable that small and large businesses and chambers of commerce say it will create jobs and grow the economy. And Nebraskans know that holding taxes down now is critical, or we risk driving up hardship and unemployment, now nearly 10 percent nationally and 4.7 percent in our state.
“We need to pass this tax cut plan now for jobs, for our economic recovery and for America’s future.”
