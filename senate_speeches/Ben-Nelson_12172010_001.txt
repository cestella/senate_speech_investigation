 December 17, 2010 – Today, Nebraska’s Senator Ben Nelson issued this statement after the Senate minority killed the Fiscal Year 2011 Consolidated Appropriations Act, or omnibus bill, and forced consideration only of funding government programs for the next couple of months with a continuing resolution.
“We are already one-fourth of the way through this budget year, and I do not support kicking the can down the road a few weeks just because some in Washington want to bail out now. This carelessness has real consequences for Nebraska. It will hurt local governments, communities and many Nebraskans,” said Senator Nelson.
“A short-term continuing resolution will result in job loss and put pressure on local governments to raise taxes in our state.
“It’s dismaying to see that at a time when a $134 million cut in state funding to education is being discussed, Congress kills a bill that provides funding for Head Start.
“And with the University of Nebraska facing a potential $50 million cut in funding, Congress kills funds for Innovation Campus in Lincoln,” Nelson added.
“Also left out of the funding is $10 million for the new U.S. Strategic Command headquarters, and $56 million to start modernizing Omaha’s aging VA hospital that serves tens of thousands of Nebraska and Iowa veterans, resulting in delays and uncertainty with these projects.
“I oppose a short-term continuing resolution because it’s not in the best interests of Nebraska and we should do better.”
