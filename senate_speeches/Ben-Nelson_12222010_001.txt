December 22, 2010 – Today, Nebraska’s Senator Ben Nelson voted for the New START Treaty between the United States and Russia, which will reduce nuclear weapons in both countries, provide for 18 on-site inspections annually and fund modernization of nuclear weapons complexes. After the Senate ratified the treaty on a bipartisan 71-26 vote, Nelson issued this statement:
“The New START Treaty is a victory for our national security that will make life safer for Nebraskans,” said Senator Nelson, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. “This bipartisan treaty reduces the number of nuclear weapons aimed at America. It enables U.S. inspectors to resume on-the-ground inspections of Russia’s nuclear facilities. Ronald Reagan promoted a nuclear policy with Russia of “trust but verify.” Without the treaty, we can’t trust and we can’t verify.
“The New START treaty also reduces uncertainty that could draw resources away from our soldiers in Afghanistan and help our enemies. It promotes a partnership with Russia that can ratchet up pressure on Iran and other nations seeking to proliferate or engage in terrorism.
“Despite the partisan rhetoric we’ve heard from those opposed, Nebraskans know the reasons I’ve cited make sense. Nebraskans, like me, also have taken note of the treaty’s bipartisan support along and endorsements from all of our top military commanders and diplomats; the President and three former presidents; all six former secretaries of state, five former defense secretaries; and seven former commanders of SAC and U.S. Strategic Command, who oversaw America’s nuclear forces and remained vigilant every moment of every day to the threat of a nuclear attack on our nation.
“Nebraskans welcome the Senate’s bipartisan ratification of this important nuclear arms reduction treaty because it gives give them peace of mind and promotes peace in the world.”
