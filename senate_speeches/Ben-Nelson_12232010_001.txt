December 23, 2010 – Today, Nebraska’s Senator Ben Nelson issued this statement wishing Nebraskans a Merry Christmas and happy holiday season:
“This is Senator Ben Nelson wishing my fellow Nebraskans happy holidays and a very Merry Christmas.
“This is a wonderful time of year. The warmth and joy of the season draws friends and family together to worship and celebrate, and I hope your holidays are full of cheer.
“Some Nebraskans, though, won’t be home for Christmas and that includes the brave men and women in the military who continue to serve our country in faraway places.
“Their mission isn’t done yet. And while they’re away I hope all of us will take time to remember them and their families.
“As Nebraska’s Senator, it is my hope and prayer that they will soon complete their mission, and return home with the gift of Peace on Earth and Good Will to all.”
