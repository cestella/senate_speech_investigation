WASHINGTON, Dec. 18 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) voted today with an overwhelming Senate majority for legislation that will end a ban on gays serving openly in the U.S. military. A 63-to-33 Senate vote to end debate set the stage for final passage of the repeal measure.
“I find it irresponsible that we deny thousands of honorable Americans the opportunity to serve our country, especially at a time when our military is stretched so thin. Discrimination of any kind is not what America is supposed to be about. As a nation, we owe those who desire to dedicate their lives to service an equal chance to do so.”
Sanders opposed the law from the beginning. In 1993, then-Rep. Sanders voted in the House against establishing the policy on homosexuality in the military. More than 13,500 service members have been dismissed under the law.
The House passed the repeal earlier in the week by a 250-to-174 vote.
