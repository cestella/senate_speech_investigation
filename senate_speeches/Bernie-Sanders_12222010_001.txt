WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) issued the following statement on Senate passage today of legislation to help 9/11 rescue workers:
“Our nation is indebted to the police and firefighters who rushed into burning buildings and saved lives on 9/11 and the workers who cleared the rubble after the terrorist attacks. Many of them are suffering debilitating illnesses as a result. They helped us recover from 9/11. We must help them recover.”
