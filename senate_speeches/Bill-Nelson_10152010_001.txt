MIAMI, Fla. –  The prospect that filthy green scum in your neighbor’s pond might one day be used to power cars, trucks and jets has researchers and start-up companies throughout Florida in a race to find ways to mass-produce fuel from algae.
 
That’s right, algae.  In Florida, the slimy organism is found just about everywhere - from backyard pools to salt and brackish waters. 
 
And that’s good news for Florida, because it means new jobs could be on the horizon – fueling excitement from government, business, and economic development leaders who believe the state’s economy could reap benefits from the emerging push to make fuel from algae.     
 
Now an effort by U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson to help turn that idea into a reality has gained traction in Congress due in part to this summer’s devastating oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
 
Last year, Nelson filed bipartisan legislation that creates tax incentives to help increase the availability and affordability of algae-based fuels by providing companies with tax credits for each gallon they produce and for the land needed to produce it.  His plan received a big boost in September when the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed similar legislation.  Now, Nelson says he’s optimistic the Senate will pass his legislation and send it to the president for his signature before the end of the year.         
 
“We’re one step closer to making Florida a leader in the production of algae-derived fuels,” said Nelson.  “While we still have a ways to go, the potential to create jobs and lessen our dependence on foreign oil is more than enough reason to act now to spur this new industry along.”
 
Below is a copy of Nelson’s legislation.
 
 
 
S. 1250
 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand the definition of cellulosic biofuel to include algae-based biofuel for purposes of the cellulosic biofuel producer credit and the special allowance for cellulosic biofuel plant property.
