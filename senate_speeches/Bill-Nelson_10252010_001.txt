WASHINGTON, D.C. –  The U.S. Department of Transportation will award $800 million more to Florida to build a high-speed rail line slated to run from Tampa to Orlando.
 
The announcement came today from Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood during a phone call with U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson.
 
The additional $800 million comes on top of $1.25 billion President Obama announced in January the state would receive for the Tampa to Orlando stretch.  The award means Florida only needs approximately $300 million more from the federal government in addition to the state’s share of funding to complete the $2.6 billion project.  The remaining federal funds could come next year.
 
“This is fantastic news for Florida,” said Sen. Nelson.  “This will ensure the state remains full speed ahead with high-speed rail construction.  As I’ve said many times, high-speed rail will be a game changer for Florida’s economy, along the likes of the Interstate system and Disney.”
 
DOT also notified Congress Monday of its intent to award an $8 million planning grant for the proposed high-speed rail line between Orlando and Miami.
