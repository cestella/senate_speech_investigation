Washington – U.S. Senator Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.) today made the following statement in recognition of Veterans Day, November 11.
“This Veterans Day we pay tribute to the 274,000 Arkansans and 25 million Americans who have served our country in the Armed Services. It is an opportunity to reflect upon the sacrifices they have made and the ideals for which they have fought. I hope that all Arkansans will take the time this day and every day to recognize our Arkansas veterans and thank them for all they have done for us.
“My father and both grandfathers served our nation in uniform and taught me from an early age about the sacrifices our troops and their families make to keep our nation free. It is critical that we provide the brave men and women of the armed forces with all they need while they are serving, and make sure they have the support and resources they require upon returning home. Throughout my public service, I have fought to ensure that our Arkansas servicemembers, veterans and their families are well cared-for.
“All of our veterans—from the Greatest Generation to the new generation of servicemembers in the Middle East and across the globe—have sacrificed greatly on behalf of our country.  Although the challenges and needs of veterans have changed over time, one thing remains constant: it is the responsibility of our nation to provide the tools necessary to care for our returning servicemembers and honor the commitment our nation made to them. Our grateful nation will not forget them when their military service is complete. It is the least we can do for those whom we owe so much.”
