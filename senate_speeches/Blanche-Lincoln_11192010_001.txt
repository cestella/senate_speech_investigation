Washington—U.S. Senator Blanche Lincoln (D-AR), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, released the following statement today following Senate passage of the Pigford –Cobell settlement. Lincoln introduced legislation earlier this year to fund the $1.15 billion settlement that black farmers reached with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in February.
“The time is long overdue to fund the discrimination settlement for farmers who have experienced decades of injustice. All farmers should receive equal access and treatment in the delivery of USDA’s programs and services and I am proud that we are finally close this chapter of discrimination within USDA. While funding this settlement will not erase the anxiety and frustrations so many hard-working farmers experienced, it will help compensate their financial losses and finally begin laying the foundation in restoring their faith in the United States government. I applaud my Democrat and Republican colleagues for coming together to pass this important piece of legislation.”
