Washington – U.S. Senator Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., Chairman of the U.S. Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, today issued the following statement after House passage of The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, to reauthorize federal child nutrition programs. The legislation, authored by Lincoln and passed unanimously by the Senate in August, makes the largest investment in child nutrition programs since their inception. It provides for the first non-inflationary increase in the federal reimbursement rate for school lunch programs since 1973, and takes a critical step toward addressing the epidemic of childhood obesity by establishing national nutrition standards for all foods sold on school campuses throughout the school day.  The bill received bipartisan support in both chambers and is completely paid for.
“Passage of  The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act puts us on a path toward improving the health of the next generation of Americans, providing common-sense solutions to tackling childhood hunger and obesity,” said Lincoln. “This bill ensures that our children will receive healthier, more nutritious meals and removes the red tape that prevents so many from participating in nutrition programs. Because of this bill, an additional 29 million meals a year will be served through afterschool programs, touching the lives of millions of Americans who are working hard to make ends meet during tough economic times. I congratulate Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Miller, and my colleagues in the House for their tremendous leadership in doing the right thing for our children and passing this bill.  I look forward to the President’s swift action to sign this legislation into law.”
