Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Blanche Lincoln today called on her colleagues in Congress to support the bipartisan tax cuts agreement announced by President Obama this week:
“This bipartisan agreement gives Arkansas’s middle-income families and small businesses the certainty they need that their taxes will not go up on January 1,” Lincoln said. “And importantly, it provides certainty for the next two years that will enable us to work together to put our economy back on track.  I urge my colleagues to support these bipartisan tax cuts.
