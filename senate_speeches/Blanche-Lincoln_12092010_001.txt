“I call the Committee to order.  Thank you all for being here today.  The Committee is meeting to consider the nomination of Ramona Emilia Romero to be General Counsel for the United States Department of Agriculture.
“Considering and approving the President’s nominees is a fundamental constitutional obligation of the Senate.  It is a responsibility that I take seriously, and gladly perform in order to confirm qualified and eager nominees so that they can carry out the vital functions of their respective agencies. 
“Ms. Romero, on behalf of the Committee, I extend a welcome to you, your family, and friends who are here today.  Congratulations on your nomination.  It represents your phenomenal academic, professional, and personal success.  Thank you for seeking a nomination which will bring your considerable talent to the USDA and public service.
“I’d like to recognize Senator Casey, who will introduce Ms. Romero.
“The USDA’s Office of General Counsel provides legal counsel and services to the Secretary of Agriculture.  The Counsel’s practice is as broad as the services performed by the agencies within the USDA.  Ms. Romero, if confirmed, you will be ultimately responsible for diverse legal functions such as litigation and rulemaking within issue areas ranging from civil rights to natural resources.  The General Counsel’s job is a daunting one, but absolutely essential to the Department’s mission.  The General Counsel must ensure that the Department acts within the authority granted to it by Congress, especially when promulgating rules and regulations to administer programs such as the controversial new GIPSA regulations.”
