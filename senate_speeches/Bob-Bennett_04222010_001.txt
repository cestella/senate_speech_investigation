Mr. President, I rise to discuss the issue that is before the body and before the country right now with respect to control and regulation of the financial services industry. The President of the United States has given a number of speeches on this one and I understand that the latest one was today in which he attacked Republicans for listening to the big banks of Wall Street in our concerns about the details of the bill that have been offered out of the Senate Banking Committee by Chairman Dodd.

I am a member of the Banking Committee. I voted against the bill in the Banking Committee. It came out on a straight party line vote and for that I'm being castigated by the president and others for being a tool of Wall Street and the big banks. I want to make it very clear, Mr. President, that my opposition to parts of this bill has nothing whatever to do with the Wall Street Industry and the big banks.

I have not been to Wall Street to discuss this with any executives of any of the big banks. I've been in Utah and I've been discussing this with businesses in Utah; businesses that you normally would not think would have any interest whatsoever in regulation of financial services. You think of financial services as insurance companies and brokerage houses and banks. Well, what I have discovered, hearing from my constituents, are the people who are the most worried about this are small businessmen and women who have nothing to do with banking, but who do have a program in their business to extend some degree of consumer credit.

I'll give you an example: A furniture store that sells furniture and advertises, "Buy now and payment is delayed for 90 days," as a way to lure people inside. Mr. President, you've seen those ads in the paper here in Washington. I've seen those ads. It's the kind of the thing that goes on; businesses extend credit in one way or the other, it's not the core of their business, it's just the way of attracting customers in and suddenly they discover that if this bill passes, they will be under control of the consumer protective agency that is being created for this. And federal officers will have the right to show up on the premises and say, "This is not a proper handling of this credit, we're going to treat you as if you were City Corp. or Goldman Sachs. We're going to come down with the heavy hand of the federal government to tell you how you can do your business and fine you or produce other types of barriers to your doing business." And the fellow says, "Look, I just want to sell a sofa and I just want to do it on credit to somebody who wants to buy it on credit. What's wrong with that?" No, under the terms of this Bill, the Consumer Protection Agency of the Federal Government will be looking down your throat.

As I move around the state, I have one small businessman or woman come up to me after another and say, "What in the world are you people in Washington thinking about the kinds of regulation you're putting on me and my business?" Some of them are saying they're afraid they're going to have to close their doors, rather than deal with this significant challenge.

We are, in this Bill, over reacting to the seriousness of the crisis that has put us in this recession. I have a friend who has been a Washington observer for years and he says, "Whenever faced with a crisis, Congress always does one of two things: nothing or over-react." And this is a classic example of over-reacting. By creating a Consumer Protection Agency, whose sole focus is to protect the consumer, we run the risk of doing the kind of damage that I've described to small business. I say to people, if safety is the only criteria by which you're going to judge an institution then the safest institution of which you're not going to lose any money is the one whose doors are closed, the one who offers no risk anywhere, because all business is a risk. So if you're going to say, "No, we're going to protect the consumer absolutely," then the way to protect the consumer absolutely so that he will never lose a dime is to not allow him to make a purchase, not allow him to ever get a loan, not allow him to ever receive any credit. If this bill passes in the form it came out of the House Banking Committee, then that will be the impact of this bill across the board. It will be to reduce credit. It will be to reduce opportunity. It will be to damage small businesses.

Again, Mr. President, I haven't talked to the people on Wall Street, I've talked to the people on Center Street, I would say Main Street because every city in America has a Main Street, but in Utah in addition to Main Street, we have Center Street in many of these small towns and that shows how close to the issue the people in Utah really are.

Now, there is another issue here that I feel strong about and that is the definition of "too big to fail." This creates and solidifies the notion that some institutions are too big to fail. I believe that one of the lessons we have learned out of the crisis that we went with through starting in September 2008, is that nobody should be deemed, "too big to fail." Indeed we should create a circumstance where the bankruptcy court handles things and there is no federal bailout in the fashion of saying that you are too big to fail and the government will protect you from failing. I remember years ago when we had the first bailout. It was Chrysler at the time. Lee Iacocca made his reputation bringing Chrysler out of the bailout and repaying the government with interest. People point that out and say the government kept Chrysler from going under. The money was re-paid, it was just a loan guarantee. The government didn't lose any money and I remember one observer said, when asked about it, "I'm not worried about whether the bailout will save Chrysler. What I'm worried about long-term is that it will work. There are people saying, â€˜What happens if it fails?' I'm not worried about it if it fails. I'm worried about it if it works and the federal government gets the appetite to step in example after example and always point out the Chrysler bailout example and say that we made money off that so we can do it again." And by creating that kind of moral hazard of stating that these institutions are too big to fail we run the risk of seeing a repetition, rather than an avoidance of the crisis that we have had that has created all of the difficulties that we have in our economy today.

So, Mr. President, on the one end, I speak for the small businessman and the small businesswoman who say this bill will be a disaster for them. On the other hand, I say let's not create in the name of protecting the customer, a circumstance where institutions are deemed as too big to fail and can be guaranteed, once again, a degree of government backing that the market place would not give them. I trust the market place and we have learned to do that as we go through the wreckage of what happened in the housing crisis.

I think we need to be very, very careful with this bill. Do we need financial reform? Yes, we do. Would I vote for a sensible bill? Yes, I would. Am I a supporter of the status quo? No, I'm not, but I don't believe that the bill that came out of the Senate Banking Committee is an improvement. I yield the floor.
