I appreciate the opportunity of visiting with you. I know you are all excited about graduating. You’re excited about completing your formal education and this is not a time for you to look back. But, you’re going into a world that will be very, very different from the somewhat protected world of a college campus. You’re going to be facing challenges that will be different from the challenges of homework or deadlines or tests and pop quizzes. You’re going to be facing a world where there is no textbook for you to turn to for answers, and challenges that will call upon everything you have learned while you are here, not specifically facts, but skills.

Of all the pieces of advice I received from my father, the best was that which I received when I was beginning my college career and asked him, “What should I major in?” At the time, my career path was very clearly laid out for me. I was going to go into the family business; the business that my grandfather had founded, my father was running and my uncle was currently in charge of. I was going to go into the family business. That was a foreordained fact and that was where I was going to spend my career. Interestingly, my father said, “Don’t major in business.” Why? He said, “We know more about the paint business down here than any professor at the University of Utah knows. Don’t major in business because we can teach it to you. The reason that I’m sending you to college,” he said, “is to learn how to think. You will forget many of the facts you learn in the classes you take, and that will be a waste of your time and my money.” It was a lot of money in those days- $60 a quarter. Learn how to think. If you learn how to think, that is something you will have with you the rest of your life. So, he said, it doesn’t matter what you major in, as long as you learn how to think. Now, he did give me this advice. He said, “Take enough accounting classes that you can draw up a balance sheet and find your way around a profit and loss statement, and take enough economics so you know how the system works. But other than that, you take whatever you want, so long as you learn how to think.” I’ve always been a political junkie, so I majored in political science, but I did indeed take the accounting, economics and history classes.   

Now, it’s more years later, than any of you are old. That was very good advice, and I have been grateful for it. The family business founded by my grandfather and run by my father, uncle and brother, no longer exists. That is a symbol of the kind of world you’re going into.  Many of the solid, firm plans you have for your career may very well disappear on you. You will have to change careers, you will have to change skills, and if you have learned how to think at Southern Utah University, you will be prepared to do that. You are entering a world of great uncertainty and challenge. Don’t fear it, embrace it.  

Let me give you some history. I have become a real student of history. The more time I spend in the Senate, the more I realize how important it is that Americans understand their history. Given what I’ve just said about the uncertainty of the lives that you are entering in your careers, let me give you a history lesson about America’s career.  

America started out with a group of people who came here for profit. They landed in a fresh water river, in a place called Virginia. The London Company, which was set up when the virgin Queen Elizabeth was on the throne, had named the land after her. The first London Company attempt to settle Englishmen and women in this country was in Jamestown, named after the then-King James; Elizabeth had passed on. The year 1607 was the beginning of this countries commencement. It did not go well. They came for profit, they found mosquitoes. They found privation and, for most of them, they found death. They persisted by having more Englishmen and women come to Jamestown to try to keep it going. Ship after ship would come in with additional people and they ran into some of the same problems, but they persisted, they learned, and they survived. Finally, they abandoned Jamestown and went inland a little more to a place they called Williamsburg.  

North of Jamestown, another group of people, under the sponsorship of the London Company, landed at a place they called Plymouth Rock. They were supposed to be settling in Virginia, but discovered they had gone too far north and were outside of the geographical stretch of Virginia. They started their own colony at Plymouth Rock. They came not for profit, but for religious freedom. They had been persecuted for their religious beliefs in England. They were called Separatists as they had tried separating themselves from the Church of England for awhile, but that didn’t work out. When they finally got a charter from the London Company to come to America, they thought this will be the place where we will have freedom of religion. Because they were outside of the control of the London Company, they drew up their own governmental set of rules and regulations called the Mayflower Compact, named after the ship they were on. They started out at Plymouth Rock. 

Others came, and soon there were additional colonies for additional purposes. Huddled along the Eastern coast of what is now the United States, there were colonies with their backs to the mountains that were impenetrable and faces to the sea. They became a seafaring people, with great ports in Boston, New York, Charlestown and Newport News. They set out to sea and they prospered. They went for a century content to be part of Great Britain. Then the time came that they decided to band themselves together in a loosely federated Congress, and declared themselves to be not 13 colonies, but 13 free and independent states. The chances of their surviving that declaration were very, very slim.  We look back and assume that the Revolutionary War was a given. All they needed to do was call up George Washington, give him a fancy uniform and he would win the war and we would be a country. It didn’t work that way and was very much like the settlement of Jamestown-difficult, depravation and death. Somehow they survived that war.   

Washington had started out a green general, not knowing what he was doing, but matured into a master strategist and tactician. He made the kinds of decisions that ultimately won the war, and they found themselves the 13 free and independent states they had declared themselves to be. Wonderful, we have won the war. We are an independent federation of 13 states, but things weren’t working. They had terrible problems and they finally realized that what they needed was a different kind of government than they had with this loosely formed powerless sort of congress. They didn’t even have a place for Congress to meet, it moved around from place to place. Washington wanted to surrender his commission to Congress but he couldn’t find them. He finally caught them in Annapolis.  

They decided they had to change their form of government and they called for a convention to get together to amend the Articles of Confederation. The convention met in Annapolis where the Continental Congress was meeting, but they couldn’t get a quorum. They didn’t have a majority of states concerned enough to even show up. So they decided to try again the next year, in 1787, in Philadelphia. This time, one of the delegates chosen by the state of Virginia who agreed to come to that convention, a man by the name of George Washington, caused the Congress to get a quorum. If Washington was going to be there, then it was worth coming. They got a quorum; all 13 states sent delegations to Philadelphia. The first thing they did was close the door, so no one would know what they were doing and elect Washington as the president of that convention. You know what happened, out of that came the Constitution.  

Read the stories of the Constitutional Convention and you find that in addition to the wonderful men that we worship and talk about on the Fourth of July, they were very, very practical politicians. They fought, they quarreled, they called each other names, they walked out and they stormed away. The New York delegation said the whole thing was a farce and that they wanted nothing to do with it. New York walked out of the Constitutional Convention, so New York did not have a vote on what would happen. Except one member of the delegation, with no authority from the others, a young man by the name of Alexander Hamilton, stayed behind and likely signed the Constitution on behalf of the state of New York, whether New York wanted to or not. 

What do I gain in trying to give you this brief history? I’m trying to tell you that commencements into new and challenging times have never been easy for Americans. The new and challenging times that you are commencing into are perhaps easier than the times that they had. If I had enough time, I could skip from the challenge of writing the Constitution to the challenge of ratifying it and how many states said no. Are you aware that when Washington was sworn in as our first president, he was sworn in as president of 11 states not 13? Because two states, North Carolina and Rhode Island, still refused to ratify the Constitution. North Carolina finally came in, Rhode Island held out until the other 12 said, “If you don’t ratify the constitution we’ll start treating you like a foreign country and we’ll send an ambassador to sit down with you.” Rhode Island finally caved in and we had 13.  

These practical politicians, when faced with a problem they could not solve, did what practical politicians always do. They kicked the problem down the road for other people to solve later on. Unfortunately, the seriousness of the problem they kicked down the road could not be solved later on. Finally, the issues of slavery and secession, the two dominate issues that overpowered everything else in American politics from the Constitution to the 1860s, tore and broke the country apart. How would you like to have your commencement address occur in 1861, when the nation was sundered apart over those two issues?  Abraham Lincoln was the president who had to try to put it back together. Those were difficult times that would make your present difficult times- looking for a job in the middle of a recession- seem pretty tame.  

There was no guarantee that Lincoln would prevail. There was no guarantee that the country would ever come back together. When it did come back together by virtue of the war, there was no guarantee that it would prosper. The North was bankrupt. The South was destroyed. Their cities burned, their fields destroyed and ravaged by war, and more of their men killed than in any other war in our history. They were challenging times. There was no guarantee in the second World War that American power would get to Europe in time to prevent Hitler from destroying Great Britain. There was no guarantee in the Cold War that the West would prevail against the Soviet Union and that freedom would be preserved around the world. Just as there is no guarantee for any of you as you graduate from this institution and commence your lives that everything will be wonderful.  Am I depressing you enough?  

Let me conclude by taking the other great lesson of America’s past. No there is no guarantee at commencement that things will work out, whether commencement is at Jamestown, at Yorktown, at Gettysburg, at the Battle of the Bulge or at the winning of the Cold War. But, is there a theme in all of these gloom and doom challenges that I’ve described to you? Yes there is, and the theme is: America has always prevailed. No matter how chillingly the confrontation ahead of you, no matter how difficult the challenges ahead of you, you can prevail. That is the great lesson of America. That is the lesson that other countries in the world were sure would not come to pass. Europeans looking at America during the Civil War pointed specifically at Abraham Lincoln and said this is what happens when a nation chooses its leaders out of the masses. Look at the baboon they got when they did not turn to the aristocracy, the well-born. They picked a common man as their leader, and look now at what that common man chosen out of the people, was able to accomplish. He had no more standing in society than any of you have. It was the genius of America that allowed him and countless others like him to prevail in the challenges that they faced.  

From all of the difficulties I have described in America’s past, and whatever they might be in your lives- and I guarantee you there will be some. Americans have always prevailed because of their faith and their determination to prevail. Faith drives out fear. The one thing I am most upset about in our present political atmosphere is how many people come up to me around the state and are afraid of the future. They say to me, “Senator isn’t this the worst time we have ever been in?” I don’t give them the speech I have just given you, I just say to them “Would you have wanted to live during the Civil War?”  

Faith drives out fear. Each of you has your own personal faith and your own personal view of the universe and who might be in charge. Hold on to that, because that is a vital part of driving out the fear in your life. Hold on to the faith you have in your country, in America’s record, and in Americans individual records of rising above the challenge. If you have faith in God, faith in your country, and from your college education faith in yourself, you too can stand before an audience fifty years after you’ve graduated and look back and say I’ve had my troubles, I’ve had my challenges, but I have triumphed. As you commence on your ship from Britain to Jamestown, wherever your Jamestown is, wherever your challenge is, keep the faith.
