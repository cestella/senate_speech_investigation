We have just heard from the President of the United States with respect to an effort to get a bipartisan health care plan. I have been to the White House summit on health care. I have heard the President speak directly to this issue. I applaud him in his effort to make sure we deal with this problem intelligently, and I accept at face value his desire that it be done in a bipartisan manner.

But as we have this discussion about doing this in a bipartisan manner, it all ultimately comes down to one sticking point that seems to be firmly established in the President's position and firmly established in the position of those who sit on this side of the aisle. At the moment, that sticking points seems to be irreconcilable. I want to talk about it in direct terms so that we understand what it is we are talking about and those who listen will understand why those of us who are Republicans are determined to stand firm on this point.

This is the point: Shall there be a public plan, a government-run option in the choices that are available to people with respect to health care?

Along with Senator Wyden of Oregon, I have cosponsored the Healthy Americans Act, which is determined to create as many options as possible, to create a wide range of choices for Americans to make with respect to their health care.

We recognize we are going to have to change the tax laws in order to give people control over their own health care dollars. Right now, health care is the only part of the economy where the individual receiving the goods or services does not control the money that pays for the goods or services. So it is obvious that you will not have market forces available in that circumstance. If the individual who is receiving the goods or services controls the money that pays for the goods or services, he or she will make a different choice than if someone else is controlling the money. But in health care, somebody else makes the choice, and that is why the core function of the Healthy Americans Act, which Senator Wyden and I are cosponsoring, says individuals should be in control of their own money and we should have as many choices as possible so that individuals can go out in the market.

There will be competing forces. Competition brings prices down. Competition creates new opportunities. Competition fills niche markets. We believe all of that will happen if we have this degree of choice.

When we have had this conversation with officials of the administration, they don't disagree. As a matter of fact, many officials of the administration have said to me: We really like what you are doing with Senator Wyden, and we applaud you, Senator Bennett, for reaching out in a bipartisan way to try to solve this problem. But we just have one additional factor we would like to add to your bill. We would like to say that as a backup, as a final option, we want a government-run plan to be there as one of the available choices, just in case none of the others work. That is, as I say, the sticking point here.

I have said to members of the administration: If we end up with a government-run plan as one of the options in my bill, I will vote against my own bill.

The government-run option will change the playing field, will ultimately drive out all of the other choices because the government is in a position to subsidize it. The government is in a position to make it more attractive than anything else and thereby gain the blessing of the voters because the voters will say: The government took care of those greedy companies that would otherwise make me pay this, that, or the other. Here, the government choice is cheaper; isn't it wonderful that the government is looking out for me? Ultimately, we would end up with a government plan, single payer for the whole country.

I know there are many of my friends on the other side of the aisle who want that, and they are very open about it and very direct about it. They say a number of things. They say the government plan is cheaper, the government plan provides health care for everybody, the government plan is fairer, and that is what we ought to have.

I wish to spend a little time talking about the experience of those countries that have adopted that attitude. If I may be personal and give my own example before I get into the statistics, I will tell you about a situation when I was living in Great Britain and had a medical problem. I won't bore you, Mr. President, with the details of the problem, simply that I went to a doctor in Scotland to see if anything should be done. The doctor first signed me up because under the British system a doctor -- this shows how long ago it was, but the system has not changed -- got a shilling a week for every patient he signed up on his list. So immediately he wanted to sign me up so he would get that shilling for having me there, which would be a decimal of a pound today rather than that old designation.

Once he had me signed up, as I say, he examined me. He said: Yes, you do need treatment. And he gave me a piece of paper that would allow me to go to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, where I was to see a surgeon. So I went to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and sat there for most of the day before a doctor could finally see me.

The doctor saw me and checked me out and said: Yes, indeed, you should be scheduled for surgery.

I said: Fine. I have a schedule. Can you give me some idea when the surgery will be so I can arrange my affairs to be available?

He said: My guess would be 9 months.

I said: I am going to be returning to the United States in less than 9 months, so I guess we can just forget this.

I communicated that to my father, who was in the United States, and he said: I don't think so. Can you get a surgeon who would operate on you right away?

So I inquired and I was told: Yes, you can get a private surgeon, but the private surgeon cannot take the health care system dollars or pounds. He is outside of it. If he stays in private practice, he cannot participate in the national health system at all.

I said: OK, that is fine.

My father said: I will pay it. Where can you go?

I went to the private surgeon and, yes, he had a practice where he took only patients who were outside of the health plan. He looked at it and said: Yes, you need surgery.

I said: All right. When?

He said: Will Wednesday be soon enough?

This was on a Monday.

I said: All right.

We went into a private hospital. It was separated from the national health service. He performed the surgery. I paid him cash, got the thing taken care of, and finished my time in Great Britain with that particular problem solved.

I would like to think that was only the case back when I was younger, but I find it is still the case, not only in Great Britain but in other countries that have this kind of problem.

Let me share a few statistics with you of what happens with respect to this single-payer system.

One of the things we are told by those who support single payers is that the outcomes in these other countries are really not any different than they are in America, that we are paying far more in America and the outcomes are basically the same. The statistic they usually use in order to prove that America is not any better is life expectancy and infant mortality. They say as a country, our life expectancy is not that much better than anybody else's and our infant mortality rate is as high or higher than other countries. Shame on us, we are not getting good health care that we are paying for.

Life expectancy is tied in very many cases to either ethnic or geographic locations. The life expectancy, for example, in Utah, where the behavior is a little different than it is in some other places, is substantially higher and has little or nothing to do with the health care. It has to do with the culture in Utah that causes people to behave in a healthier lifestyle.

Let's go beyond this broad-brush approach and look at some specifics.

The largest international study to date has found that the 5-year survival rate for all types of cancer among both men and women is higher in the United States than in Europe. Isn't that a statistic showing that we are getting a better result in America than in Europe? A cancer survival rate is not something that is due to the geography of where you are born. If you are born in the inner city, that has something to do with infant mortality rates, or if you live in a healthy environment, that has something to do with life expectancy. Cancer survival rate has to do with health care, and the health care in the United States is better than it is in Europe and has produced a higher survival rate for both men and women.

In Britain, there are one-fourth as many CT scanners per capita as there are in the United States and one-third as many MRIs. If we think the CT scanner and the MRI produce a better result in terms of health care, we want to be in the United States. We do not want to be in one of these single-payer, government plans of the kind President Obama wants as an option destroying the other options and choices there would be if we pass the Healthy Americans Act.

The rate for treating kidney failure -- dialysis or transplants -- is five times higher in the United States for patients between the ages of 45 and 84 and nine times higher for patients 85 years and older. Again, there is a personal interest here because members of my family have kidney disease. I want them in the United States with the kind of system we have where they do not have to wait and they do not have to worry about government regulations. I want them here where it is five times better than it is in Europe with respect to kidney disease.

Right now, nearly 1.8 million Britons are waiting for hospital or outpatient treatments at any given time -- 1.8 million waiting in the circumstance that I described in my own situation. In 2002 to 2004, dialysis patients waited an average of 16 days for permanent blood vessel access in the United States, or 20 days in Europe, and 62 days in Canada. We often hear about the benefits of being in Canada. I have constituents who come from Canada, who have moved to Utah. Every time this comes up, they come to me and say: Senator, whatever you do, do not give us the Canadian system. Whatever you do, make sure that America doesn't go in the direction the Canadians have gone.

Let me give you some examples to demonstrate why that is good advice. This is one that broke out in the debate in the Canadian Parliament. A woman by the name of Emily Morely, in March of 2006, was informed by her doctor that her cancer had spread and she needed to see an oncologist, and then she was told: You will not be able to get an appointment for months. Well, if my cancer is spreading, I don't want to wait months for an appointment. Her family raised a ruckus, they called the local newspaper, a petition was signed by her neighbors demanding she get care, and then, in response to that, the government got her to a specialist. Once again, in the government, you respond to the voters. If you are getting bad publicity in the press, or the voters don't like what you are doing: Oh, let's take her to a specialist. So she got to a specialist and he told her she had only 3 months to live.

Well, she at least had time to put her affairs in order. Had she not had the intervention of her family and her neighbors, it is quite likely she would have died before even seeing an oncologist for the first time.

But let's go to another example that may be even closer to home to the legislators. A member of Parliament in Canada, Belinda Stronach, strongly supports the Canadian health care system, and she would object to this kind of argument that the Canadian health care system isn't very good. But where did she go when she was diagnosed with cancer in 2007? She went to California and paid for the treatment out of pocket. Even a member of Parliament who supports the Canadian system recognized that the government plan didn't work for her. And with her own health at risk, she came to America and took advantage of what we offer here.

There is the case of the mother in Calgary, Alberta who was expecting quadruplets. I am the father of twins, and they came as a great surprise. Quadruplets is something I am not sure we could handle, and certainly they would require very good facilities to deal with a pregnancy that produces quadruplets. She is in Albert, Canada, and she is flown to Great Falls, MT, to deliver the quadruplets. Great Falls, MT, is not thought of as one of the great centers of health care excellence in the United States. Yet the facilities in this small town in Montana were better than any facility available anywhere in Alberta.

These are the examples of a government-run plan and because people who are getting the service don't control the money the government plan can end up focusing on overall cost control to the detriment of the people who are trying to access it. I don't think ultimately the American voters, having gotten used to the access that they currently have -- being used to the idea that they do not have to wait -- would ultimately tolerate a government plan.

My consult to President Obama and to my colleagues here in the Senate is to slow down a little. We are talking about restructuring 18 percent of the entire economy. We spend 18 percent of our GDP on health care. I agree absolutely that it is long past time that we addressed this issue; that we rationalize the challenge; and that we do things that make it far more effective.

As I have spent the last 3 or so years working with Senator Wyden to try to understand the problem and fashion the Healthy Americans Act in a way that will solve the problem, I have discovered a great truth that I didn't realize before, and that is this: The greatest cost control factor in health care is quality. The best health care is the cheapest health care. And it has been achieved in those places that have focused on quality first and the patient first, and it has not involved any government intervention.

Dartmouth has done a study and told us the three cities in the United States where you get the best health care. They are Seattle, WA; Rochester, MN; and Salt Lake City, UT. I take some pride in that fact. And then the Dartmouth study goes on to say that if every American got his or her health care in Salt Lake City, UT, it would not only be the best in the United States, it would be one-third cheaper than the national average.

Those are the kinds of examples we should be focusing on and learning from, and then doing our best to write legislation that would support that. Slow down. We are not going to understand this in time for any artificial deadline set for some political agenda. I understand the sense of urgency that the Obama administration feels on this issue, and I share the idea that now is the time to address it. This is the Congress in which we should pass it. But I don't think setting a deadline to say it must be done in July when we are talking about 18 percent of GDP, is that persuasive.

We can examine these alternatives a little more carefully than the present deadline will allow us to do. We can say: All right, why is quality the best cost control, and does our bill create the kinds of incentives and rewards focused on quality that will produce that result, instead of saying: Whatever else you do, you have to have a government option in there. You have to have a government plan that can compete with all the rest of this, and thus set us up for the kind of situation where we would move as a nation to imitate Great Britain or Canada or the others that have produced the kinds of examples I have talked about here.

So I am more than willing and I am anxious to work with President Obama and his administration, to work with my friends across the aisle. I have worked with Senator Wyden for these past 3-plus years to try to fashion an intelligent solution. But I repeat what I said at the beginning: The sticking point in this entire debate is the demand on the part of the Obama administration that the final product have within it a government plan as one of the options. And if that happens, I vote against my own bill. If that happens, I do everything I can to say no. Because I am convinced if that happens, we end up with a situation where there is only one option that survives.

One of my colleagues has described this, I think, quite well. He says: Having a government plan as one of the options is a little like taking an elephant into a room full of mice and then saying: All right, this is a roomful of animals, let's let them compete. And as the elephant walks around the room, pretty soon there aren't any mice left. A government plan is the elephant in the room.

Those of us who want to solve this problem intelligently say: Let's learn from the examples of those people who have adopted a single-payer system. Let us realize that the American experiment in health care produces better outcomes in all of the areas I have outlined. And as politicians, let's realize that the American voter will never stand for the kind of rationing by delay that seems to have crept into every other system. Let's take our time to do it right. There is a bipartisan consensus to get it done. We can work together and make that accomplishment, if we are not quite so insistent that the government plan ultimately is the only way to go.
