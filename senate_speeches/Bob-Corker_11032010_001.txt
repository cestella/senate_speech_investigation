U.S. Senator Bob Corker, R-Tenn., made the following statement congratulating Governor-elect Bill Haslam and other winners of Tuesday’s elections. 

“Tennesseans love our state, and tonight is filled with excitement about our future,” said Corker. “I am glad the citizens of our state have gotten to know the Bill Haslam I know. Bill has helped build a great company, met a payroll, been actively involved in civic endeavors, and managed tough budgets as mayor of Knoxville – as he will now do at the state level. Bill knows what it means to attract jobs and has already started working to bring businesses to Tennessee. I know he will be an outstanding governor for our state. In Crissy, Bill has a true partner, and Tennesseans will be most fortunate to have her as our first lady. 

“In Tennessee and all across the country we have seen a groundswell of activism, interest in government and a focus on fiscal issues, and this has produced some excellent candidates. I congratulate all of tonight’s winners and look forward to working with them to rein in out-of-control spending, to eliminate burdensome regulation that stifles job creation and to get our country working again.”
