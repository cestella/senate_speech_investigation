U.S. Senator Bob Corker, R-Tenn., was the keynote speaker for the Veterans Day ceremony at the Cumberland County Veterans Memorial Park today in Crossville. The annual event, sponsored by the Cumberland County Veterans Council, recognizes veteran organizations and branches of the United States armed forces.

“One of the greatest honors I have as a U.S. senator is the opportunity to meet with members of our military and their families. They, and all of the veterans that have worn our nation’s uniform, represent what is best about America. This Veterans Day, I hope Tennesseans will join me in expressing gratitude to our service members, past and present, for their sacrifices on our behalf,” Corker said.
