U.S. Senator Bob Corker, R-Tenn., today made the following statement regarding General Motor’s stock offering Thursday, November 18.

“There’s no question the government’s injection of taxpayer funds in GM was inappropriate. I voted against it and believe strongly that it never should have happened. But in the winter of 2008 the writing was on the wall: either Congress or the White House was going to extend loans to GM and Chrysler. The matter came before the Senate Banking Committee and ultimately the Senate, and I determined that if taxpayer monies were going to be used, it would be worth pursuing an approach where the automakers could return to profitability and the American people could be made whole to the greatest extent possible. 

“Ultimately we failed in the Senate to get firm agreements among GM’s stakeholders, namely the UAW, to successfully streamline the company, and I voted against the legislation which ultimately failed.  As predicted, the Bush administration went on to extend the loans without congressional approval. In the end, the concessions among the bondholders, the union, and the company that I had laid out in hearings before the Senate Banking Committee formed the roadmap for GM’s future restructuring under a government-sponsored bankruptcy. What was obvious to me at the time and is crystal clear now is that without reducing GM’s debt load and bringing wages in line with its foreign competitors, GM never would have reemerged as the company it is today.”

“As a taxpayer and someone who represents thousands of taxpayers in Tennessee, I am pleased with GM’s stock offering. Like me, I think American taxpayers want General Motors to be successful because they want to see American businesses succeed and Americans employed and because they want to see a return on their huge investment in this company. I hope over time the full return on investment will occur,” Corker said.
