U.S. Senator Bob Corker, R-Tenn., made the following comments today after voting against food safety legislation that authorizes $1.6 billion in federal spending over five years without commensurate cuts in spending.

“I hoped to vote for enhancements to food safety that would not lead to increases in overall federal spending, but unfortunately I was not able to get a vote on my amendment which would have offset the cost of this bill with unobligated federal funds. Obviously, I believe ensuring a safe food supply is an important role of the federal government, but we have to find a way to pay for our priorities instead of adding to our debt. Washington has a spending problem, and while the price tag for this legislation is small in Washington terms, it’s this pattern of spending that has gotten us in the unsustainable position we are in today,” Corker said.

Corker’s amendment, #4710, would have offset any new spending under the food safety bill, S. 510, with a rescission of unspent, unobligated federal funds. Under the amendment, the Office and Management and Budget (OMB) would determine the funding source.
