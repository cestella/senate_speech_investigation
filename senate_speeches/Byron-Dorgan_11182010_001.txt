U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan, Chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Aviation, Operations, Safety and Security, and Senator John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV, Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, are pushing their colleagues to pass the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Bill in the lame duck Congress.

U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan, Chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, said “the failure to pass a bill that will modernize our air traffic control system, promote greater safety in the skies, and do the things necessary to support our aviation system in America will be a significant loss for our country.”

“We’ve done short term extension of the FAA Reauthorization Bill 16 separate times since 2007 and now is the time to get this bill done,” said Senator Dorgan.

“Those of us who have negotiated between the House and the Senate have reached agreement on the majority of what is in the legislation. I believe it is important to make one more effort to get the benefits of this bill through before the end of this year. Doing so will create substantial jobs, as well as modernize and improve our air traffic control system,” said Senator Dorgan.

“We have relied on too many short-term reauthorizations and stop-gap measures. It’s time to get this Reauthorization Bill passed,” Chairman Rockefeller said. “This bill will improve the safety of our skies, modernize our air traffic control system and support jobs. The time to act is now.”

The passing of a full authorization will provide the FAA much needed stability for its grant-making process to fund critical aviation infrastructure projects. The bill will strengthen airline safety, modernize America’s air traffic control system, and support jobs. The FAA Reauthorization is also important to our aviation stakeholders and international partners who depend on the clarity this legislation offers on critical certification and support programs.
