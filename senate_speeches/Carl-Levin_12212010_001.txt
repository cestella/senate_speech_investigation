WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate approved legislation today that would approve the contract for workers in Michigan and Wisconsin to build 10 Littoral Combat Ships for the Navy. The legislation is expected to be approved by the House of Representatives within hours and signed by the President this week. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and other lawmakers from Michigan and Wisconsin sought the provision, which approves the Navy’s proposal to split production of the vessels between Marinette Marine of Marinette, Wis., just over the state line from Menominee, Mich., and a shipyard in Alabama. The contract for Marinette Marine is expected to fund 500 direct jobs in Michigan, and support up to an additional 2,500 jobs in Michigan.

Levin, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, held a hearing on the Littoral Combat Ship program on Dec. 14.

“Today’s action is a major boost for the region’s economy. It is also an endorsement of the skilled and dedicated workers who work at Marinette Marine,” Levin said. “The Navy is confident that this approach will help keep our industrial base healthy. It’s a win not just for our own workers, but for national security and the taxpayers.”

Without the legislation, the Navy would have been required to select one contractor for the next phase of LCS construction. Earlier this year, the Navy decided to change its acquisition strategy and move from a sole-source contract to a contract involving both shipyards in order to maintain competition. Navy officials say that approach will get more ships to the fleet sooner and save as much as $1 billion.

The LCS program is essential to the Navy’s efforts to prepare for current and future conflicts. The ships are designed to operate close to the shore, with greater speed, stealth and maneuverability than vessels now in the fleet. They will have the capability to support troops ashore, to combat enemy surface vessels and submarines, and counter enemy mines.
