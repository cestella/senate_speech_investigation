U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer today announced that the FY 2011 Omnibus Appropriations Act includes $1.6 Million for Network-Centric Communications development at UAlbany’s College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering. The funding will allow researchers at CNSE to develop an advanced superconductor prototype of an all-digital radio frequency system for the U.S. Navy. This system will increase performance while cutting energy consumption. Schumer worked closely with members of the Congress to include funding for the project in this year's omnibus bill.

“CNSE’s work on nanotechnology has made it a national leader in the field and a driving force in the region’s economic development,” Schumer said. “This project is just a part of the Capital Region’s transformation into a national high tech corridor. Investments like these will pay dividends in jobs and economic activity all while bolstering the work of our troops.”

The $1.6 million in federal funds will allow the University at Albany's College of Nanoscale Science & Engineering to develop an advanced digital supercomputer for U.S. Navy radio frequencies. Network-centric communications will provide increased performance, less energy usage and more secure communication transmissions. This funding will also lower cost and pave the way for higher quality commercial wireless systems. The investment will boost Albany NanoTech’s reputation as a national leader in nanotechnology and aid our troops during a time of two wars.

The Omnibus still needs to pass the Senate, but inclusion in this critical spending bill is a huge step forward.  The Senate is poised to vote on the bill in the coming week.  If the bill is not passed, the Senate will either have to pass a continuing resolution, funding the government at the 2010 levels, or the federal government will be forced to shut down.
