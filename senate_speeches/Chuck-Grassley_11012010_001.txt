Senator Chuck Grassley today said that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders has awarded a $225,000 grant to the University of Iowa.
 
According to the Department of Health and Human Services, the university will use the funds to conduct biological research related to deafness and communicative disorders.
 
Each year, thousands of local Iowa organizations, colleges and universities, individuals and state agencies apply for competitive grants from the federal government.  The funding is then awarded based on each local organization or individual’s ability to meet criteria set by the federal entity administering the funds.
