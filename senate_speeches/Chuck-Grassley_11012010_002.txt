A new Disaster Recovery Center will open this week in Boone County to assist individuals, households and businesses affected by the recent storms and flooding in Iowa.
 
The Boone County Disaster Recovery Center will be located at Luther City Hall, Five Luther St., in Luther, and will be open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 8 a.m. to noon on Saturday, until November 9, 2010.  The registration period for disaster assistance ends November 12, 2010.  The deadline applies to registration only.  It is not the deadline for all related paperwork. 
 
According to the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), Disaster Recovery Center visitors may:
 
 Get help completing applications for federal low-interest disaster loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration for homeowners, renters, businesses of all sizes, and private non-profit organizations
 Inquire about the status of applications for federal assistance
 Obtain referrals to voluntary organizations that may help with immediate unmet needs
 Learn cost-effective mitigation measures to reduce the impact of future disaster losses
Representatives from FEMA and the U.S. Small Business Administration can help answer questions and provide recovery information. Additional materials about assistance programs from other federal and state agencies are available at the centers.
 
“In the past, these Disaster Recovery Centers have been helpful in providing in-person assistance to Iowans needing information,” Senator Chuck Grassley said.
