 Senator Chuck Grassley today said that the U.S. Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has awarded funding totaling $4,883,232.83 to Keokuk and the National Czech & Slovak Museum and Library in Cedar Rapids.
 
Keokuk will receive $1,217,522.52 to fund improvements to the Forebay basin.
The National Czech & Slovak Museum and Library will receive $3,665,710.31 to fund electrical, mechanical, plumbing and structural system improvements.
 
FEMA obligates funding for these projects directly to the state.  It is the state's responsibility to ensure that the eligible sub-grantees receive these awards.  FEMA contributes 75 percent of the total cost of a project.  State and local entities contribute the other 25 percent.
