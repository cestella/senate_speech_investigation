Senator Chuck Grassley said today that the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded a $500,000 grant to Westinghouse Airbrake Corporation in Cedar Rapids through the Railroad Safety Technology Program.
 
The company will use the funds to improve Positive Train Control track database verification and validation.  Positive Train Control systems are integrated command, control, communications, and information systems for controlling train movements with safety, security, precision, and efficiency.
 
According to the Department of Transportation, the Rail Safety Technology Program provides grants to passenger and freight rail carriers, railroad suppliers, and state and local governments for projects that have a public benefit of improved railroad safety and efficiency.  The grant program has a maximum 80 percent federal and minimum 20 percent grantee cost share match requirement.
 
Each year, thousands of local Iowa organizations, colleges and universities, individuals and state agencies apply for competitive grants and loans from the federal government.  The funding is then awarded based on each local organization or individualâ€™s ability to meet criteria set by the federal entity administering the funds.
