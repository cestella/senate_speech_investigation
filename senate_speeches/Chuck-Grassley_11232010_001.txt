Senator Chuck Grassley today said that Advanced Heat Treat Corporation in Waterloo has received a $149,887 grant from the National Science Foundation. 
 
According to the National Science Foundation, the corporation will use the money to help fund the project titled, “"SBIR Phase I: Plasma Enhanced Nanostructures for Improved Tribology of Gray Cast Iron Stamping Dies.”
 
Each year, thousands of local Iowa organizations, colleges and universities, individuals and state agencies apply for competitive grants and loans from the federal government.  The funding is then awarded based on each local organization or individual’s ability to meet criteria set by the federal entity administering the funds.
