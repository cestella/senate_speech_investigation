Senator Chuck Grassley today said that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will award two grants totaling $54,420 to Iowa fire departments.
 
The Iowa City Fire Department will receive $18,348 and the Primghar Fire Department will receive $36,072.  Both grants will be used to help improve operations and safety at the departments.
 
“It’s important that firefighters have the support, equipment and training they need to do their job to the best of their ability,” Grassley said. “Their lives, and the lives of others, depend on it.”
 
According to the Department of Homeland Security, Assistance to Firefighters Grants are used to recruit and train firefighters, purchase equipment and improve fire stations and facilities. 
 
Each year, thousands of local Iowa organizations, colleges and universities, individuals and state agencies apply for competitive grants from the federal government.  The funding is then awarded based on each local organization or individual’s ability to meet criteria set by the federal entity administering the funds.
