Senator Chuck Grassley today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Railroad Administration has awarded a $371,373 grant to the National Ag-based Lubricants Center at the University of Northern Iowa.
 
According to the Department of Transportation, the center will use the funds to study the use of readily biodegradable lubricant and greases in railroad equipment.
 
“This project will help provide important insight into the effectiveness of using ag-based products on railroad equipment.  In addition to the possibility of being a great benefit to railroads, the use of these products could increase economic opportunities in rural communities throughout the United States,” Grassley said.
 
Each year, thousands of local Iowa organizations, colleges and universities, individuals and state agencies apply for competitive grants from the federal government.  The funding is then awarded based on each local organization or individual’s ability to meet criteria set by the federal entity administering the funds.
