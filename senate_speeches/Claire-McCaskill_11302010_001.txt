WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senators Claire McCaskill and Kit Bond introduced a resolution to honor legendary author Samuel Clemens, who wrote under the pen name Mark Twain, on the 175th anniversary of his birth. This year also marks the 100-year anniversary of Twain's death and the publication of his long-awaited autobiography. Today's resolution honors his birthday and his enduring legacy to American literature.

"So much of Twain's work is still as relevant today as it was during his lifetime, and I often draw upon his wisdom. From his portrayals of the institution of slavery in America to his wide collection of satire, Mark Twain was a great author and a great Missourian, and his legacy deserves this honor," McCaskill said.

"Mark Twain was not only a brilliant author, but remains a true American treasure," said Bond. "Those of us who call Missouri home are proud to call him a fellow Missourian and this resolution is but a small way to honor him and his works which continue to inspire and entertain millions across the globe every year."

Twain was born on November 30, 1835 in Florida, Missouri. He was raised in Hannibal - the inspiration for the fictional home of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, two of his most famous literary characters. He began his career as a printer's apprentice at the Missouri Courier Newspaper and worked in a number of fields throughout his career including as a printer, journalist and steamboat pilot. His works often drew upon his Missouri roots.
