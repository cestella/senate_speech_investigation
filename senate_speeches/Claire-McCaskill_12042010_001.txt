WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, after Republicans blocked measures that would have provided permanent tax cuts for American making up to one million dollars, U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill lambasted her colleagues for refusing to help struggling middle class families in order to try and force the Senate to pass tax cuts for the very wealthiest in the country. McCaskill believes that the United States has historically flourished as a result of its vibrant middle class, but these families have faced harder times during this recession. She feels that Congress must focus on lifting up the middle class and small businesses in order to turn our economy around and create new jobs, but cannot afford to continue giving tax bonuses to the very wealthiest Americans. After today's vote she made the following statement:

"We should extend the tax cuts for everyone in the middle class. In this economy allowing the lower rate to continue for all Americans on their first million dollars in income makes some sense. But for all Americans with incomes above a million, we need to just say no. It's time to fight for the middle class and deficit reduction," McCaskill said. "The Republicans are willing to hold the middle class hostage and add over 300 billion dollars to the deficit all to give millionaires more help. No one in America should take Republicans seriously on the topic of deficit reduction."

McCaskill also spoke yesterday on the Senate floor about the need for this compromise. Watch here.
