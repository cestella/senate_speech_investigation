WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Federal Transit Administration awarded Jackson County, through the Mid-America Regional Council, $1.8 million in grant funding to conduct an Alternatives Analysis for the Kansas City Regional Rapid Rail project. The funding is a first step towards establishing a commuter rail system in the Kansas City area, by conducting a preliminary study supporting the transportation needs in the defined travel corridor.

"This award is great news for Jackson County and the Greater Kansas City area. Mike Sanders and the Kansas City Chamber of Commerce have worked so hard to pursue funding to make this rail system a reality. I'm glad the Department of Transportation saw the tremendous economic benefit this project would bring to the area and chose to award them this critical funding. I will continue to do my part to move this project forward," McCaskill said.

Earlier this year, McCaskill sent a letter to DOT Secretary Ray LaHood urging him to support Jackson County's grant application, because of the need to develop a more modern and viable transportation network in the Kansas City region. Additionally, the letter outlined how a rapid rail system would help grow the economic development of the region.

McCaskill believes that federal grants and loans are a positive alternative to earmarks, which in the past have frequently had too little accountability. Competitive merit and need based federal grants and low-interest government loans bring federal assistance to Missouri in an honest and fiscally responsible manner.
