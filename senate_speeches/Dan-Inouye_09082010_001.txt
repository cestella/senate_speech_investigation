Three Oahu elementary schools have been recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as among the top 300 public and private learning institutions in the country this year, Senators Daniel K. Inouye and Daniel K. Akaka announced today.

 Ewa Beach Elementary, Momilani Elementary and the Royal School have been recognized as 2010 National Blue Ribbon Schools.

 The Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and private elementary, middle and high schools whose students achieve at very high levels or have made significant progress and helped close gaps in achievement, especially among disadvantaged and minority students.

 The program is part of a larger Department of Education effort to identify and disseminate knowledge about best school leadership and teaching practices. 

 “The education situation in Hawaii is extremely challenging as teachers, students, and parents deal with shrinking budgets and the lingering effects of furlough Fridays.  I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to these fine schools and to the students, teachers, parents and support staff who worked through fiscal hardship to ensure that our next generation of leaders receives the knowledge and guidance they require,” said Senator Inouye. 

 “I am very pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has designated three of our Hawaii schools as 2010 National Blue Ribbon Schools.  I commend the teachers and staff at Ewa Beach Elementary, Momilani Elementary, and Royal School for their hard work and dedication to ensuring our keiki have the education they need to succeed,” said Senator Akaka.
