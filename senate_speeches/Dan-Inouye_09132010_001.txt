More than $400,000 has been awarded to the University of Hawaii and the Honolulu Police Department to help manage children’s exposure to violence and to work through a backlog of DNA forensic casework, Senator Daniel K. Inouye announced today.

The funds come from two grants awarded by the U.S. Department of Justice. 

“Ensuring the safety of our citizens is the greatest responsibility we have as elected officials,” said Senator Inouye.  “These funds will help criminal investigators identify culprits and sift through critical evidence. The money will also help the University of Hawaii develop programs to shield our children from violence, a critical part of ensuring a child is allowed to develop with little negative influence.”

The Safe Start Promising Approaches Project at the University of Hawaii: $249,299
This project will develop and support practice enhancements and innovations to prevent and reduce the impact of children's exposure to violence in their homes and communities. The project will help communities implement collaborative and evidence-based practices across the services continuum for children and their families. Exposure to violence includes being a victim of violence or a witness to violence, and encompasses abuse, neglect or child maltreatment, domestic violence, and community violence.

Honolulu Police Department, Crime Lab: $162,603The federal funds will help reduce forensic DNA sample turnaround time, increase the throughput of public DNA laboratories, and reduce DNA forensic casework backlogs. These improvements are critical to preventing future DNA backlogs and to helping the criminal justice system use the full potential of DNA technology.
