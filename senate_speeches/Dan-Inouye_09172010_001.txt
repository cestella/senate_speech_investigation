Kauai, Maui and Hawaii island will receive more than $5 million to buy new buses and maintain and expand service, Senator Daniel K. Inouye and Senator Daniel K. Akaka announced today.

Hawaii will receive $5,669,400 through a grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation.  The state Department of Transportation will administer the grant money and distribute it to the counties.

The money will be used for bus purchases and transit enhancements on Hawaii, Kauai and Maui.

Honolulu also received $196,000 to buy two additional para-transit buses.

“The transportation of our citizens and visitors is critical to our economy.  Kauai, Maui and Hawaii island do not have the transportation infrastructure that exists on Oahu so it is critical that government provide alternatives to driving and hopefully lessen the traffic burden experienced by commuters,” said Senator Inouye.

“These federal funds will allow Kauai, Maui and the Big Island to invest in new buses and improve service for neighbor island residents.  Buses help families, commuters, and the environment by providing greater accessibility, reducing traffic congestion, and lowering overall pollution,” said Senator Akaka.
