Hawaii will receive more than $900,000 to setup impaired driving checkpoints in all four counties, Senator Daniel K. Inouye and Daniel K. Akaka announced today.

The Honolulu, Maui, Kauai and Hawaii County police departments will split $972,388 and setup road blocks, increase patrols and implement other impaired drunk driving countermeasures.
 
The funds come through a grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation.  The money will be administered by the Hawaii Department of Transportation.

There were 53 alcohol related traffic fatalities in Hawaii last year compared to 50 in 2008, according to statistics kept by the county police departments.

“Impaired driving is a senseless crime that often ends in serious injury or death. These funds will help police on all islands arrest impaired drivers and educate the community about the dangers of drinking and driving,” said Senator Inouye.

"Drunk driving causes pain, suffering and death, and these funds will help Hawaii enforce the law and educate drivers to prevent tragedy," said Senator Akaka.
