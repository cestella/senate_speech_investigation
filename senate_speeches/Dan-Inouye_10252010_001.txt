The Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement will receive $3.15 million to expand financial education opportunities for Native Hawaiians seeking to buy a home, establish savings accounts and improve their credit scores, Senator Daniel K. Inouye and Senator Daniel K. Akaka announced today.

The funds come through the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) grant for Financial Education and Counseling (FEC) Pilot Programs. 

“Today’s economy makes it difficult for working families to buy a home.  Credit is tight and banks are heavily scrutinizing prospective homebuyers.  This grant will help Native Hawaiians navigate the complicated financial landscape,” said Senator Inouye.

“Growing up in a family that did not even have a bank account, I know how financial education can empower people and improve their lives,” said Senator Akaka.  “These Treasury funds will help Native Hawaiian families develop the financial skills they need needed to invest in a home and save for the future,” said Senator Akaka.

The FEC Pilot Program provides grants that will have the ultimate goal of identifying successful methods of financial education and counseling services that result in positive behavioral change for financial empowerment, and establishing program models for organizations to deliver effective financial education and counseling services to prospective homebuyers.
To achieve these purposes, the CDFI Fund will make awards to organizations that provide a range of financial education and counseling services to prospective homebuyers, with the goals of:
 1) increasing the financial knowledge and decision-making capabilities of prospective homebuyers
2) assisting prospective homebuyers to develop monthly budgets, build personal savings, finance or plan major purchases, reduce debt, improve financial stability, and set and reach financial goals
3) helping prospective homebuyers improve credit scores by understanding the relationship between credit histories and credit scores
4) educating prospective homebuyers about the options available to build savings for short- and long-term goals.
