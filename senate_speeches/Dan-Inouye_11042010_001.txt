Senator Daniel K. Inouye issued the following statement today.

“I’m deeply humbled and extremely grateful for the support and the Aloha demonstrated by the people of Hawaii.”

“The prospects for our people in this economy are grim.  I want to get to work right away on projects and policies that will create jobs and kick start economic growth.  We need to put people back to work so they can provide for their families.”

“I look forward to returning to Washington and meeting with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to help plan a collaborative course forward.  Given the results of Tuesday’s election, most of my colleagues are concerned with the challenging days ahead.  I too am concerned.”

“However, I will wait to spend some time with my new colleagues, both Democrat and Republican, in both chambers, to assess the nature of this challenge.  It is too early to draw a battle line.  I will do my utmost to apply my approach since the 1960’s – bipartisanship.  I believe it has worked for me over the years and hopefully, in some way, helped our legislative process.”
