Senator Daniel K. Inouye issued the following statement today.  Senator Inouye is a retired U.S. Army Captain who earned the Medal of Honor while fighting with “E” Company of the 442 Regimental Combat Team in Europe during World War II.

“Today is a reminder that the freedom we enjoy is defended by brave men and women who have fought, bled and died for our great nation.  I experienced these sacrifices first hand in Europe during World War II and I know the price that has been paid repeatedly over the years to keep Americans safe.  Right now American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan are in harm’s way, far away from their families.  We must honor their plight and thank them for what they have given and what they continue to give to protect our way of life.”
