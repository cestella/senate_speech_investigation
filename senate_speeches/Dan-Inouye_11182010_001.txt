The Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC) has received a $110 million loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to expand renewable energy initiatives including hydroelectric power plants and a biodiesel refinery, Senators Daniel K. Inouye and Daniel K. Akaka announced today.

The $110 million guarantee includes nearly $73 million for hydroelectric plant improvements and a 10 MW naphtha/biodiesel fueled combustion turbine.

Hydroelectric power and biomass conversion accounted for nine percent of KIUC’s fuel mix in 2009.  The company will use the loan to expand both programs. 

There are currently six hydroelectric power stations on Kauai.

“These funds will help Kauai further harness the power of water and biofuel as part of an effort to lessen the county’s dependence on imported fossil fuels,” said Senator Inouye.  “In Hawaii we are blessed with unique access to renewable, sustainable sources of power and, for the sake of our environment and our economy, we have to continue our collaborative push toward a clean energy future.”

“Developing renewable energy like hydroelectric and biodiesel helps us to make the transition away from dirty, imported fuels,” said Senator Akaka.  “These homegrown energy sources keep dollars in Hawaii while reducing pollution to our air, land, and water.”

Hydroelectric power captures the kinetic energy of water as it moves from a high elevation to a lower elevation by passing it through a turbine. The amount of kinetic energy captured by a turbine is dependent on the distance the water is falling and the flow rate of the water.

KIUC is one of 50 rural utilities and cooperatives in 31 states selected to receive guaranteed loans.

The loan guarantees are funded by USDA Rural Development's Rural Utilities Service.

The loans are used to fund upgrades, expansion, maintenance, and replacement of rural America's electric transmission, distribution lines and generating equipment. The Electric program also helps fund energy conservation and renewable energy projects.
