I rise to congratulate Hawaii's senior Senator, my good friend and longtime colleague, Senator Dan Inouye, on his impressive milestone.  

On Friday, Senator Inouye became the second-longest-serving Senator in the history of this storied institution.  

Dan was sworn into the Senate in 1963 - just a few years after Hawaii became a state.  At the time, he was the first and only Japanese American to step foot in this room as a member of this prestigious body.  Today, he is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.  Dan Inouye did not just break barriers, he shattered them.  

Of course, the Senate is only the most recent chapter in Dan Inouye's lifetime of service to our country, which includes his Medal of Honor service in the Army during World War Two, and his service in the Hawaii Territorial Legislature and the United States House of Representatives.  

Hawaii may be the youngest state in this great country, but as Senator Inouye's milestone demonstrates, our contributions continue to shape the United States of America.  

From President Barack Obama, who grew up not far from Senator Inouye's childhood home on the island of Oahu, to each teacher, soldier, construction worker, and farmer, we are proud of the many accomplishments of Hawaii's people.  We are proud to be the 50th state, and we are proud of Senator Inouye's long career serving our nation.  

Aloha and congratulations Dan.

Thank you.
