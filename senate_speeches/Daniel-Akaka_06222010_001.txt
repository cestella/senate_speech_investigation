In Hawaii all beaches are public.  It is one of the things that makes our state a special place, and it is due to a landmark 1968 ruling by the Hawaii Supreme Court authored by Chief Justice William S. Richardson.  As a military veteran, attorney, political party leader, elected official, state supreme court justice and trustee of Hawaii?s largest private landowner, Chief Justice Richardson?s many contributions helped shape our nation?s youngest state. This great man, a dear brother and friend, died yesterday at the age of 90.

 As Chief Justice of the Hawaii Supreme Court from 1966 to 1982, C.J., as many of us affectionately knew him, did so much to preserve Hawaii?s rich culture and heritage.  As he explained it, ?Hawaii has a unique legal system, a system of laws that was originally built on an ancient and traditional culture. While that ancient culture had largely been displaced, nevertheless many of the underlying guiding principles remained. During the years after the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1893 and through Hawaii?s territorial period, the decisions of our highest court reflected a primarily Western orientation and sensibility that wasn?t a comfortable fit with Hawaii?s indigenous people and the immigrant population. Thus, we made a conscious effort to look to Hawaiian custom and tradition in deciding our cases - and consistent with Hawaiian practice.?

 A self-described ?local boy from Hawaii,? C.J. graduated from Roosevelt High School and the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and received his law degree from the University of Cincinnati.  In World War II, he joined the U.S. Army and served as a platoon leader with the 1st Filipino Infantry Regiment.  He was later inducted into the Infantry Officer Candidate School Hall of Fame. C.J. served as the Chairman of the Hawaii Democratic Party and as the state?s first Lieutenant Governor of Hawaiian ancestry.  Upon retirement from the Hawaii Supreme Court, Chief Justice Richardson served as a trustee of the Kamehameha Schools. 

 C.J.?s modest beginnings influenced his future dedication to the underrepresented, minority, and indigenous communities of Hawaii. His mixed heritage of native Hawaiian, Chinese, and Caucasian ancestry reflected the diverse culture and history of the people. He understood the issues most important to the people and fought hard to ensure that the legal system provided remedies for the most vulnerable populations.  He will also be remembered for his work to establish the state?s only law school - The William S. Richardson School of Law.  Chief Justice Richardson fought vigorously for its creation because he believed Hawaii students who could not travel to or afford mainland law schools should have an opportunity to study law nevertheless.

 Chief Justice Richardson was a true son of Hawaii. He lived his life in service to others and did so with a warm and kind disposition. We celebrate his life, achievements, and contributions to the state of Hawaii.
