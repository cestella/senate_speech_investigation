Nine years ago, our country suffered a vicious attack.  We continue to mourn those who lost their lives that day.

Today, Americans gather to remember the thousands of men, women, and children who lost their lives on September 11, 2001.  We send our thoughts and prayers to all the families who lost loved ones aboard those hijacked aircraft, at the World Trade Center, and at the Pentagon.

We also honor the heroic service, actions and sacrifices of those first responders, law enforcement and military personnel, volunteers and others who aided the innocent victims and, in so doing, bravely risked or sacrificed their own lives.  Despite the tragedies of that day, September 11 will always be a day when we honor those heroes, reflect on their sacrifices, and remember the resilience our Nation showed during those dark hours.  

On this Ninth Anniversary of 9/11, let each of us continue our resolve, individually and collectively, to make sure that such a terrible tragedy never happens again.
