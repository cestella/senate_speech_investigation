I rise today to introduce the Furthering International Nuclear Safety Act of 2010.  This bipartisan legislation, which is cosponsored by Senators Carper and Voinovich, will enhance the implementation of the Convention on Nuclear Safety by taking a more systematic approach to improving civilian nuclear power safety.  

   The Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine in 1986 was the worst nuclear power accident in history and made clear the need for international nuclear safety norms.  According to a report commissioned by United Nations agencies, millions of people were exposed to high doses of radiation and approximately 350,000 people were displaced from their homes.  On top of this, the countries most directly impacted by the disaster were estimated to have suffered economic damages on the order of hundreds of billions of dollars, while thousands of square miles of agricultural and forest lands were removed from service.  

   In the aftermath of this accident, over 50 countries, led by the United States, worked together to develop the Convention on Nuclear Safety.  This Convention was formally established in 1994, and the United States joined in 1999.  Through the cooperative nature of the Convention, which relies on peer-reviewed national reports and the sharing of best practices, countries that are party to the treaty have been able to improve their nuclear safety.

   Although civilian nuclear power programs have become safer, we must not be complacent.  As history has shown, a nuclear accident in one country can have devastating effects across several countries.  Currently there are over 400 civilian nuclear power reactors operating in 29 countries around the world, and at least 56 more are under construction.  Countries such as Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Libya, Thailand, and Vietnam are interested in starting civilian nuclear power programs.  The construction of new nuclear power facilities, along with an increasing number of countries readying to build nuclear power plants, should be accompanied by greater attention to nuclear safety.  

   Earlier this year, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) completed a review of the Convention in which GAO obtained the views of 40 parties to the Convention, while carefully protecting individual respondent information.  GAO found that the Convention has been very successful in improving nuclear safety, but made recommendations to the United States Government that would enhance the Convention?s effectiveness.  

   The bill I am introducing today will implement GAO?s recommendations and additional steps to improve safety.  This bill requires the United States delegate to the Convention to take certain actions to enhance international nuclear safety.  This includes the United States advocating that parties to the Convention more systematically assess their own progress in improving nuclear safety through the broader use of performance metrics.  Additionally, to increase access to information about nuclear safety and implementation of the Convention, the delegate to the Convention will encourage parties to post their annual reports and answers to questions from other parties on the International Atomic Energy Agency?s (IAEA) public website.  IAEA will be encouraged to offer additional support, such as providing assistance as needed for the production of parties? national reports; support for Convention meetings, including language translation services; and providing additional technical support to improve civilian nuclear power program safety.  Further, the United States delegate will encourage all countries that have or are considering establishing a civilian nuclear power program to join the Convention.  Finally, this bill calls for the Secretary of State to lead the development of a United States Government strategic plan for international nuclear safety cooperation for operating power reactors, and to report on the plan?s implementation and the progress on implementing this bill.

   International nuclear safety deserves our Nation?s ongoing attention.  As we approach the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, we should be mindful that the use and expansion of nuclear power needs to be combined with supreme vigilance and concern for safety. 

   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.  Thank you.
