(Washington, D.C.) – U.S. Sen. David Vitter today applauded the defeat of the omnibus appropriations bill. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Thursday evening that he would not bring the massive spending measure to the Senate floor for a vote.

"Defeating the pork-laden omnibus appropriations bill – $1.2 trillion, 1,924 pages, more than 6,000 earmarks – is a huge victory for the American people. This will allow the new, more conservative Congress to start to really go after spending and debt," said Vitter.

Prior to Reid’s decision to pull the bill, Vitter joined a group of senators who announced their intention to force the full reading of the bill on the Senate floor.
