(Washington, D.C.) – U.S. Sen. David Vitter today made the following comments after the U.S. Senate defeated the DREAM Act, legislation that would have provided a powerful incentive for more illegal immigration by granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens who entered the U.S. as minors and met loosely defined “educational requirements.”


“I’m very pleased that we were able to defeat the illegal alien student bailout known as the DREAM Act once and for all,” said Vitter. “This bill would have allowed at least 2.1 million illegal aliens to receive immediate amnesty and be granted lawful permanent resident status, allowing them to then petition the government for green cards for their family members.


“With unemployment rates near ten percent and government spending at unsustainable levels, the last thing legal tax-paying American citizens need is to see their hard-earned money used to finance the education of illegal aliens and encourage more illegal immigration. Today’s bipartisan vote reaffirms what I have long argued – that the American people want stronger border enforcement and will not tolerate amnesty in any form,” said Vitter.


Vitter serves as the chairman of the U.S. Senate Border Security and Enforcement First Immigration Caucus.
