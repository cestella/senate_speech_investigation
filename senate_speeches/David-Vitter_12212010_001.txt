(Washington, D.C.) – U.S. Sen. David Vitter today commented on the Census Bureau’s announcement of a new congressional apportionment map, under which Louisiana will lose a seat in the House of Representatives while states with higher totals of illegal immigrants will gain seats.


“Even though we’ve been expecting this, the confirmation that Louisiana will lose a congressional seat is frustrating. Last year, I tried to prevent this from happening with my amendment to require a citizenship question on the census and to prevent the counting of illegal immigrants for the purpose of apportionment,” said Vitter. “Now, Louisiana stands to lose clout in Congress, while states that welcome illegal immigrants stand to unfairly benefit from artificially inflated population totals.”


Several studies conducted prior to the census predicted that Louisiana would lose a congressional seat if illegal immigrants were included in the numbers used for apportionment. Had Vitter’s amendment passed, Louisiana would have retained all seven of its seats in the House of Representatives.


Vitter serves as chairman of the U.S. Senate Border Security and Enforcement First Immigration Caucus.
