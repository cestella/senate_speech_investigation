DETROIT— U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), a member of President Obama’s Export Council, today made the following statement regarding the U.S.-Korea trade agreement negotiations.
 
“We need trade agreements that increase market access to U.S. goods so that we are exporting our products, not our jobs. I am pleased this week that President Obama insisted that the trade deal with Korea is fair to our American auto industry and farmers. I encourage the Administration to continue negotiating a trade agreement that will combat unfair trade barriers, so our manufacturers and farmers can access Korea’s markets and create American jobs.”
