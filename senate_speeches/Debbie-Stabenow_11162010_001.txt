WASHINGTON— U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement in reaction to the Chevy Volt being named Motor Trend’s “Car of the Year” for 2011.
 
“Congratulations to General Motors, and the Chevy Volt team, for winning this prestigious award. The result of high-quality, clean-energy innovation, the Chevy Volt is further proof of GM’s continued success. This award is also a testament to the hardworking men and women who are making the battery packs, building the engines, and assembling the Volt right here in Michigan.
 
“Congratulations also to Ford and Chrysler, which had vehicles among this year’s top finalists. It is great to see our American automakers take home the ‘Car of the Year’ award two years in a row.” –U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow
