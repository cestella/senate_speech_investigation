WASHINGTON — U.S. Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Carl Levin, both D-Mich., congratulated Marquette’s Peter White Public Library today for receiving the nation’s highest honor for libraries. The Institute of Museum and Library Service will present the National Medal for Museum and Library Service to the library at an upcoming Washington, D.C. ceremony along with a $10,000 award. Peter White Public Library is one of five libraries in the nation to receive the honor. One other Michigan library, West Bloomfield Township Public Library, also received the award this year.
 
“The Peter White Public Library of Marquette is a jewel of the community and truly merits the recognition of the 2010 National Medal for Museum and Library Service,” Stabenow said. “The library not only serves the City of Marquette but also nine surrounding townships, providing books for over 36,000 people. Their educational and musical programs create a venue where families can continue to enjoy the arts, and I am pleased that this award recognizes all of their hard-earned efforts.” 

“For all that it has done to bring the world to Marquette, the Peter White Library is deserving of this great award, giving it the recognition as one of the nation’s top public libraries that it has earned,” Levin said. “Marquette is fortunate to have this public library leader right in its own downtown, and it is clear from the library’s data that residents are taking full advantage of this great resource. I applaud the library for its achievement and thank its staff for their service to the community.”
