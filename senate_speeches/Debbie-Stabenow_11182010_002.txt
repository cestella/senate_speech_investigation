WASHINGTON— U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) made the following statement after the Senate unanimously passed legislation to ban the import of Asian Carp to the United States.
 
“As the Army Corps works on a permanent solution to the spread of Asian Carp into the Great Lakes, this legislation will provide further protection by banning all shipping and importing of Asian Carp to the United States.  Protecting our Great Lakes from Asian Carp, and other invasive species, is vital to our economy and the preservation of one of the world’s most valuable resources.  I will continue to push for a permanent separation between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River to keep Asian Carp from entering the Great Lakes.”
