WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow today made the following statement after voting to proceed to the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act .
 
“I have deep concern that this package includes additional tax cuts for millionaires that have been proven not to create jobs and only add to the deficit. What does create jobs is cutting taxes for working people and middle-class families, which is why, in the end, I voted to move forward with this bill. In addition to important tax cuts for working families and small businesses, it also includes a desperately-needed extension of federal unemployment benefits, which is the only lifeline thousands of Michigan families have right now.” –U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow.
