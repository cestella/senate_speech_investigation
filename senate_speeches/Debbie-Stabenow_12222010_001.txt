WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) today made the following statement after the Senate voted to ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty also known as START.
 
“Today’s vote was vital to our national security, and now that the Senate has renewed our arms treaty with Russia, we take an important step in protecting our country from threats of terrorism.  Since the old START treaty expired, there have been no inspections of nuclear weapons in Russia. Today’s vote allows U.S. inspectors to get back to work so they can account for Russia’s nuclear stockpile, helping ensure the safety and protection of our nation against foreign threats.”  –U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow
