WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) announced today that she has nominated 34 Michigan students for placement at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, M.D., the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, C.O., and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y.
 
“I am proud that so many exceptional students from our state are willing to serve our country through military service,” said Senator Stabenow. “These individuals have demonstrated their excellence in and out of the classroom, and I am confident that they will represent Michigan well.”
 
Students seeking appointment to a service academy must first obtain the nomination of their U.S. Senator, their U.S. Representative or the President. Students nominated by Senator Stabenow’s office went through a competitive application process that included interviews by community leaders. Now that the students have been nominated, they must await acceptance for admission by the academy to which they have applied.
