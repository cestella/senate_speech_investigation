The Federal Trade Commission today announced that starting May 10, 2011, manufacturers must display EnergyGuide labels on television sets, offering consumers information about how much energy different models use.

The new rule comes in the wake of a December 2009 letter to FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz sent by U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). In that letter, she called for the FTC to quickly complete its final regulations to apply EnergyGuide labels to new television sets. The labels will disclose the annual energy cost of the television and include a graphic comparing that cost with other similarly sized televisions.

“The Federal Trade Commission’s decision recognizes that televisions account for almost 10 percent of an average household’s energy consumption, and consumers deserve the chance to make an educated decision on their television purchases,” Senator Feinstein said.

“Increasing energy efficiency in homes is one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Without national energy efficiency standards, consumers are the best tool we have to reduce household energy use, thus lowering energy costs and driving innovation.”
