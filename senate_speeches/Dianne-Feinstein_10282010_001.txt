 U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, today vowed to cut waste and duplication from the intelligence budget in the next session of Congress.

Senator Feinstein’s remarks came in response to the Obama Administration’s announcement today that the appropriated level for the intelligence community and military intelligence totaled $80 billion in Fiscal Year 2010.

That includes $53.1 billion in the national intelligence program and $27 billion for military intelligence, including supplemental funding for counterterrorism and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

“The intelligence budget has doubled since 2001, with huge growth in personnel, facilities, and operations costs,” Senator Feinstein said. “Given the nation’s financial situation, it is my view that the intelligence budget needs to be carefully reviewed and that cuts will be necessary. 

“As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I intend to identify and remove any waste and unnecessary duplication in the intelligence budget and to reduce funding for lower priority activities. It is clear that the overall spending on intelligence has blossomed to an unacceptable level in the past decade.”
