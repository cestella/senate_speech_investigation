U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer (both D-Calif.) today urged Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood to transfer to California federal grant monies designated for states that plan to cancel their high-speed rail projects.

In their letter to Secretary LaHood, the senators note California’s commitment to high-speed rail, including voter approval of more than $9 billion in bonds for high-speed rail to link Northern and Southern California.

Following is the text of the letter:

November 16, 2010

The Honorable Ray LaHood
Secretary
U.S. Department of Transportation
1200 New Jersey Ave., SE
Washington, DC 20590

Dear Secretary LaHood:

It has come to our attention that several states plan to cancel their high-speed rail projects. We ask that you withdraw the Federal grants to these states and award the funds to states that have made a strong financial commitment to these very important infrastructure projects. 

California voters have committed over $9 billion in bonds to high-speed rail, putting our state in a unique position to advance this initiative quickly. Our state’s plan has widespread, bipartisan support because of the impressive potential for job growth, its impact on energy independence and its transformational role in how Californians move throughout the state. No other state is as ready, as able, or as determined to develop a high-speed rail system in the near future. 

California stands ready to be a pioneering partner with the U.S. Department of Transportation. Awarding our state’s plan with these funds would have the greatest and most immediate impact in advancing the kind of high-speed rail system envisioned by both California and the Obama Administration.

Thank you for considering this request. We look forward to working with you on this matter.
