 U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today said that Congress should swiftly and permanently extend tax cuts for middle class families while allowing similar tax cuts for upper-income individuals to expire.

"Middle-class Americans are really struggling right now, but this economy has been very good to upper-income individuals and the well-to-do. I don't see the logic in delaying tax cuts for middle class Americans as part of an effort to make sure that the rich get richer. I would caution my Republican colleagues against holding middle-class tax cuts hostage for the benefit of the two percent of Americans who have the privilege to be wealthy. If taxes rise on middle class Americans due to these obstruction tactics, the opposition party will be responsible."
