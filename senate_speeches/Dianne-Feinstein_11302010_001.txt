U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today issued a statement calling on Senate Republicans to support a swift end to the military's "Don't ask, don't tell" policy.

          Following is Senator Feinstein's statement:

          “The Pentagon study released today is more powerful evidence that it is time for the military to stop discriminating against gay and lesbian Americans in uniform. Some 70 percent of troops confirmed that serving side-by-side with gays and lesbians would not harm morale.

          I don’t see how Republicans can continue to fight for this backward and discriminatory policy when a vast majority of our troops have expressed support for equality. The criteria for serving in our armed forces should be competence, courage, and a willingness to serve; not race, gender, or sexual orientation.

          I stand with Secretary Gates, Admiral Mullen and tens of thousands of other men and women in uniform who agree that it’s time to relegate “Don’t ask, don’t tell” to the dustbin of history. It is my hope that all of my colleagues will have the wisdom to do the same.”
