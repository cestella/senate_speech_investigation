 U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) today released the following statement after learning that the competition to host the storage site for FutureGen 2.0 has moved into the next phase after six Illinois communities – City of Quincy, Christian County, Douglas County, City of Tuscola, Morgan County, Pike County and City of Vandalia – submitted full proposals to the FutureGen Alliance. The storage site will receive and store carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from an upgraded power plant in Meredosia, Illinois, and will also host Carbon Capture and Sequestration research, education and training, and visitors’ facilities.

“I am pleased to see that the FutureGen Alliance is moving forward on schedule with the site selection competition for FutureGen 2.0,” said Durbin. “I am confident that the proposals from all six of communities will be given fair consideration in the competition established by the FutureGen Alliance in consultation with the Department of Energy and the State of Illinois. With a promise that these facilities will create economic development, provide good-paying jobs and attract researchers and visitors from around the world, it is no surprise that so many communities have expressed interest.”

On October 6, the FutureGen Industrial Alliance announced the details of a process that will lead to the selection of an Illinois site for the storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) collected at an Ameren Energy Resources power plant in Meredosia, Illinois. The FutureGen 2.0 project and pipeline network is expected to bring 1,000 jobs to downstate Illinois and another 1,000 jobs for suppliers across the state.
