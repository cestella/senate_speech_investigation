Assistant Senate Majority Leader Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Senator-elect Mark Kirk (R-IL) met today in Durbin’s Washington office to discuss ways in which they will work together on Illinois priorities in the 112th Congress.
 
“Senator-elect Kirk and I had a very constructive discussion about the challenges that face Illinois in the years ahead,” said Durbin.  “Though we may disagree on some issues, we agreed that there is much common ground when it comes to Illinois.  Our state has a long tradition of bipartisan cooperation and we both know that it is in the best interest of Illinois to have their two Senators working together.   I look forward to working with my new colleague.”
 
"The people of Illinois want to see their elected leaders work together to solve problems and improve quality of life,” said Kirk.  “Senator Durbin and I held a productive discussion this morning on ways we can work together to build our state's infrastructure, defend our environment and keep our communities safe.  While we may not agree on every issue, I look forward to building a bipartisan pro-Illinois agenda that puts our state ahead of partisan politics.
