U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) today announced that the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which he is a member, unanimously approved Kenneth Bohac to serve as U.S. Marshal in the Central District of Illinois. His nomination will now proceed to a vote by the full Senate.

“Through many years of service to Illinois and his country, Kenneth Bohac has established a reputation for responsibility and professionalism in the law enforcement community,” said Durbin. “It was an honor recommending Kenneth’s name to President Obama and I look forward to joining my Senate colleagues in voting for his nomination.”

Bohac served as a Deputy U.S. Marshal in Urbana, Illinois from 1998-2007, and since 2007 he has served as a Deputy U.S. Marshal and Judicial Security Inspector in Lexington, Kentucky. From 1995-1998, he served as a Deputy U.S. Marshal in Chicago. Bohac served a six-month tour in Iraq as a member of the Special Operations Group of the U.S. Marshal Service.

Last year, Durbin established three bipartisan screening committees to assist in selecting Federal District Court Judges, U.S. Attorneys, and U.S. Marshals for Illinois. The screening committees were comprised of 22 distinguished Illinoisans drawn from various aspects of the legal profession and include former judges, prominent litigators, law professors, bar association leaders and former prosecutors and defenders. Springfield attorney James Potter serves as chairman of the Central District Screening Panel.

The screening committees reviewed applications and references, conducted interviews and recommended the names of several individuals for each vacancy. Durbin reviewed the screening committees’ recommendations, conducted interviews of finalists, and in consultation with members of the Illinois Congressional delegation, submitted the finalists’ names to the President, who makes the final decisions on nominations.
