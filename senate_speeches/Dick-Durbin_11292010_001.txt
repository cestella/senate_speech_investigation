 U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) today escorted Senator-elect Mark Kirk (R-IL) onto the floor of the U.S. Senate for his swearing in ceremony.  Kirk was sworn-in this evening by Vice President Joe Biden as Senator from Illinois.
 
 “I was honored to escort Senator Kirk to his swearing in ceremony,” said Durbin.  “I look forward to working with him and carrying on our state’s long tradition of bipartisan cooperation.” 
 
Kirk resigned his position as U.S. Representative of Illinois’ 10th District earlier this evening.  He replaced Senator Roland Burris (D-IL) in a seat that was previously held by, among others: President Barack Obama, James Shields, Everett Dirksen, Adlai Stevenson III, Alan J. Dixon, Carol Moseley Braun and Peter Fitzgerald.
