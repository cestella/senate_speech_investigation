 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce endorsed Assistant Senate Majority Leader Dick Durbin’s (D-IL) FDA Food Safety Modernization Act today, saying it will “improve America’s ability to prevent food borne illness and boost consumer confidence in U.S. food supplies while minimally burdening small farms and consumers,”
 
“This legislation would improve food safety by requiring all food manufacturers to develop a food safety plan, providing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with new tools to ensure the safety of imported food, and employing a rational, risk-based approach to inspection,” wrote R. Bruce Josten, Executive Vice President of the Chamber of Commerce. “On this basis alone the Chamber supports final passage of the bill.”
 
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act is a bipartisan bill that focuses on four key areas where FDA’s authorities and resources need to be improved: food-borne illness prevention; food-borne illness detection and response; food defense capabilities; and overall resources. A one-page summary of the bill is attached.
 
In addition to Chamber of Commerce, more than 30 groups, representing both consumers and industry, support the bill including: Consumer Federation of America; Consumer’s Union; Food Marketing Institute; Grocery Manufacturers of America; National Restaurant Association; PEW Charitable Trust; Safe Tables are Our Priority (STOP); Sargento; and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.
 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world’s largest business federation representing the interests of more than three million businesses and organizations of every size and sector.
 
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act is expected to come to a final vote before the Senate late today.
