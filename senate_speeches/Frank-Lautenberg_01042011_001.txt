NEWARK, N.J. – U.S. Senators Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) and Robert Menendez (D-NJ) today announced that the Robbinsville Fire Department will receive $700,604 in federal funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) program to hire four additional firefighters. The highly competitive SAFER grant program is designed specifically to strengthen departments by increasing the number of trained firefighters.

“This federal funding will help staff the Robbinsville Fire Department with additional firefighters to protect local families and neighborhoods,” said Lautenberg, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security which funds the SAFER grant program. ?“With firefighters ready to roll at the sound of the alarm, we must be certain that our departments are sufficiently staffed to handle emergencies safely and efficiently.”

“Additional firefighters protecting Robbinsville’s families will mean a safer community,” said Menendez. “Our brave firefighters don’t hesitate to put themselves in harm’s way in the line of duty. They deserve the manpower and equipment necessary to safeguard our neighborhoods and themselves.”

The highly competitive SAFER grant program provides funding directly to fire departments and volunteer firefighter organizations in order to help them increase the number of trained "front line" firefighters in their communities.
