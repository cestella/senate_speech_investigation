WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and one of the Senate’s leading critics of offshore drilling, released the following statement on the Department of Interior’s new policy on offshore oil and gas exploration:

“Protecting coastal economies from devastating oil spills was the right policy before the Gulf disaster, and it is the right policy after the Gulf disaster,” stated Lautenberg. “This decision takes New Jersey’s beaches and vibrant coastal economy out of the path of the next drilling disaster and provides an opportunity to focus on 21st century energy solutions that move our nation beyond dirty fuels. I will continue to fight for clean energy solutions and permanent protections against drilling so that New Jersey never has to face the economic pain and environmental suffering that is still affecting the Gulf coast.” 

In late March, Senator Lautenberg derided the Administration’s plan to expand offshore drilling into the Atlantic Ocean, calling it a “Kill, Baby, Kill” policy that threatened the coastal environment, jobs and economies. Today’s announcement reverses that plan. Sen. Lautenberg’s complete statement from March is available here.
