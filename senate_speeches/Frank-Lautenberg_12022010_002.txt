WASHINGTON—U.S. Sens. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) and Robert Menendez (D-NJ) today announced that President Barack Obama has nominated Magistrate Judges Claire Cecchi and Esther Salas to be U.S. District Court Judges for the District of New Jersey.

“Judges Cecchi and Salas have shown great skill and ability in the courtroom and both will serve New Jersey extremely well as Federal District Court judges,” stated Lautenberg. “I will work with my colleagues in the Senate to make sure these widely respected judges are confirmed and the vacancies on our District Court are filled.”

“I am proud to have recommended these experienced and well-respected judges to the president for nomination to these important positions in our judicial system,” stated Menendez. “Cases that rise to the level of our U.S. District Courts are of great consequence to the safety and financial security of our families. Judges Salas and Cecchi have the intellect and temperament to serve with distinction and effectively enforce the rule of law. I look forward to working for their confirmation in the U.S. Senate.”

Earlier this year, Lautenberg and Menendez recommended the nomination of both judges to the White House. Judges Cecchi and Salas have served as Magistrate Judges in the District Court for the District of New Jersey since 2006.
