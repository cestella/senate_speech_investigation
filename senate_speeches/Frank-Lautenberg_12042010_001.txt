WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) released a statement today blasting Senate Republicans for blocking two efforts to provide permanent tax cuts for middle-class Americans. 

“Today’s votes paint a clear picture of how far Republicans are willing to go to protect the super wealthy. It defies belief that Republicans will refuse a tax cut to the vast majority of the country because millionaires won't get one,” Senator Lautenberg said. “The GOP is holding everyone's tax cut hostage until Paris Hilton gets hers. The Republicans have put the country club ahead of the country.”

This morning, the Senate voted on legislation that would provide permanent tax cuts for middle-class families earning $250,000 or less. After Republican Senators blocked action on the bill, the Senate Democrats then offered an amendment that would extend tax cuts to families earning up to $1 million per year. Again, Senate Republicans blocked passage, demonstrating they are willing to put the financial interests of multi-millionaires and billionaires ahead of everyone else. Senator Lautenberg voted in favor of both proposals.
