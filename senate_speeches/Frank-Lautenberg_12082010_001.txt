WASHINGTON, D.C. – As Social Security recipients face a second straight year without a cost of living adjustment (COLA), Senate Republicans today voted down legislation to provide $250 in emergency benefits to seniors. U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ), a co-sponsor of the “Senior Citizens Relief Act,” supported the bill to help seniors on a fixed income stay afloat while they wait another year for an increase in benefits. 

“This legislation offered a critical lifeline to seniors and a boost to our economy,” Lautenberg said. “It is unconscionable that while Republicans want to give the average millionaire a $100,000 tax cut, they are denying the average senior citizen a $250 check to help pay for food and medicine. More than 1.4 million seniors in New Jersey and millions more across the country fell victim to the Republican tax strategy of helping the rich get richer and leaving everyone else to fend for themselves.”

In New Jersey alone, there are more than 1.4 million Social Security recipients who would have been eligible for this vital aid. Under the bill considered on the Senate floor today, all Social Security recipients, railroad retirees, SSI beneficiaries and adults receiving veterans’ benefits would receive $250 in emergency relief in lieu of a cost-of-living adjustment. Since individuals living on fixed incomes are most likely to spend this money, this bill would also provide a significant boost to the economy.
