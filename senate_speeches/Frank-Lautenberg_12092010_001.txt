WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ), an Army veteran, released the following statement today after Senate Republicans blocked debate on the Defense Authorization bill.  The bill, which authorizes funding for the military, also includes a provision to repeal the  “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy:  
 
“Senate Republicans refuse to even begin debating a repeal of the ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ policy.  The other side has run out of excuses.  Eliminating ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ is the right thing to do and would ensure that our military policy reflects the values of our nation.  

“The fact that Republican Senators are willing to hold up a bill that provides vital resources to our troops and ends discrimination in our military is deplorable.  I will continue working to pass a Defense Authorization bill that provides our military with the equipment and services they need while also bringing an end to discrimination within the ranks.”
 
Senator Lautenberg is a co-sponsor of S.3065, the Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2010, which would repeal current Department of Defense (DOD) policy concerning homosexuality in the Armed Forces and was incorporated into the Defense Authorization bill.
