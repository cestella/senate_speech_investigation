WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) expressed outrage after Senate Republicans blocked passage of the “James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act,” which seeks to provide health care for first responders and workers sickened by toxic exposure resulting from the World Trade Center attacks.
 
“Since the Civil War, no event has changed life in our country as much as September 11th, and it is simply unconscionable for Senate Republicans to abandon the men and women who served our nation in response to the attack,” said Senator Lautenberg.  “Thousands of New Jerseyans were among the heroes who answered the cries for help and rushed into the devastation at the World Trade Center.  Nearly a decade later, many continue to suffer from the toxic dust they breathed in at Ground Zero and just this week another brave first responder who worked there perished.  These men and women didn’t think twice about putting their nation first, and now their nation must put them first.  I will continue fighting to pass this bill in the Senate.”      
  
Lautenberg is a co-sponsor of the “James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act.”  The legislation would create a fund to pay for the monitoring and treatment of health conditions that resulted from the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks.  In addition, the bill would reopen the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund to applications from individuals who did not apply because they were not sick at the time of the filing deadline in December 2003.
 
The House of Representatives passed the bill in September, but it has been unable to clear the Senate.
