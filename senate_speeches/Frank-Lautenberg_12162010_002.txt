WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) applauded the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) for approving new safety standards for baby cribs, including a requirement that crib hardware be more durable. Lautenberg advocated for increased crib durability after meeting with a New Jersey family and learning about how their 14-month-old daughter was injured when her crib collapsed.

“These new standards will ensure that parents don’t have to worry about their child’s safety when they lay them down to sleep,” Senator Lautenberg said. “Cribs are often reused by siblings or passed down to other family members, but when parts become worn down, children could be put in harm’s way. These new durability requirements will make sure that cribs are stronger and safer for our children.”

Crib safety standards are being updated for the first time in three decades. Previously, manufacturers have never been required to test their cribs to determine durability. As a result, crib collapses have occurred that may have been prevented had the cribs been properly tested. To address this problem, Senator Lautenberg secured language in the FY 2009 Omnibus Appropriations bill directing the CPSC to consider requiring cribs to be subject to durability testing. 

The new rules will require crib hardware to be more durable, make safety testing more rigorous, make mattress supports stronger, and completely ban the manufacture and sale of drop-side cribs. Effective June 2011, cribs manufactured and sold in the United States must comply with the new federal standards.
