WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) released the following statement in response to remarks by Senator John McCain (R-AZ) that the Senate has been “fooling around” with consideration of the “James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act.”
 
“It’s shocking to learn that Senator John McCain said the Senate is ‘fooling around’ by trying to pass a health care bill for 9/11’s first responders.  The 9/11 workers are heroes, too, and they should be treated as such.  They have paid a price for their courage and we owe them the same courtesy as others who have served America.  This is not just a New York matter, it is a national matter,” Lautenberg said.  

Lautenberg noted that in Arizona alone, there are more than 100 workers being monitored for exposure to toxic substances at Ground Zero.
