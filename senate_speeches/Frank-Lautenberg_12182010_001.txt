WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ), an Army veteran, today voted to repeal the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy and bring an end to discrimination in the military.

“Eliminating ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ is the right thing to do and will ensure that our military policy reflects the values of our nation,” Lautenberg said.  “Today's vote is a major step forward in the effort to guarantee equal rights for all Americans.  This is a civil rights victory that will soon bring an end to the discriminatory policy that wrongly bars Americans from serving their country simply because of sexual orientation.”

The “Don’t Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010” was approved in the House of Representatives on Wednesday.  Today the Senate overcame the 60 vote procedural hurdle that will allow final Senate passage of the bill in the coming days.   Once approved, the bill will go to the President’s desk to be signed into law.

Senator Lautenberg co-sponsored two measures introduced in the Senate to repeal Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.
