WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ) today hailed the Senate’s approval of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START). 

“Senate approval of the New START treaty puts America on the path to a safer and more secure future,” Lautenberg said. “This historic agreement will reduce the number of nuclear weapons around the world and help keep the most dangerous and destructive weapons out of the hands of rogue states and terrorists.” 

The New START Treaty will require the U.S. and Russia to reduce their nuclear weapons over the next seven years and allow the U.S. to resume inspections of Russia’s nuclear arsenal. President Obama signed the treaty with Russia in April, setting it up for today’s Senate vote on final ratification.
