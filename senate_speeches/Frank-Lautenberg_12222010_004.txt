WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ), an Army veteran, released the following statement today after he attended the President’s bill signing ceremony for the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” repeal law. 

“Today’s bill signing marks an historic milestone in our pursuit of equal rights for all Americans,” Lautenberg said. “I was proud to be with President Obama as he signed the law that will bring an end to the military’s discriminatory policy. Repealing ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ is the right thing to do and will make our country and our military stronger.” 

The “Don’t Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010” was approved in the House of Representatives last week and in the Senate on Saturday, December 18. 

Senator Lautenberg was a strong supporter of the repeal and co-sponsored two measures introduced in the Senate to repeal “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”
