WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Frank R. Lautenberg (D-NJ), Robert Menendez (D-NJ) and U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ-06) today announced a $461,500 federal grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) to the New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium. The Consortium will use the federal funding for environmental research, public outreach and education programs to support and protect New Jersey’s coast.
 
“New Jersey’s coastline is a precious resource that creates jobs and drives our state’s economy,” Lautenberg said.  “This federal Sea Grant funding will ensure that New Jersey’s research institutions and communities can continue our mission of protecting this state’s rich coastal resources and environment.”   
  
“When our coastline is healthy and protected, our coastal communities can thrive, our state’s economy can prosper, our environment can be preserved,” said Menendez. “This is an important investment in the research and programs that will help achieve those goals.”
 
“The New Jersey Sea Grant College Program plays an important role in ensuring New Jerseys coastal resources are protected,” said Pallone, a former fellow in the Sea Grant Program.  “We need the research, education and community outreach that Sea Grant provides, especially considering the new and varying challenges that New Jersey now faces in protecting our coasts.  I have found New Jersey Sea Grant to be an effective partner in tackling threats such as contamination in our waters, sustainability of our fisheries or new problems caused by global warming.”
 
The New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium is an affiliation of colleges and universities dedicated to supporting New Jersey’s marine and coastal environment through research, education and outreach to local communities.  The $461,500 grant will support local research initiatives that address local coastal and marine issues.
