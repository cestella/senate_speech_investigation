(Washington) – U.S. Senator George LeMieux (R-FL) today announced his support for and cosponsorship of a bill introduced by Senator Scott Brown (R-MA) extending emergency Unemployment Insurance benefits. The bill will extend emergency benefits to nearly one-million unemployed workers across the country. The cost of the measure is offset without increasing taxes or adding to the national debt, instead it would be paid for by unspent Federal funds to be determined by the Office of Management and Budget.

“Congress should extend emergency benefits to those who can’t find work and we should pay for that assistance. On November 2nd, the American people spoke loud and clear. They elected new leaders to represent them in Congress with two very pressing issues at hand. Those two issues are job creation and out of control government spending.” LeMieux said. “Our government is putting this country on the brink of financial disaster. Floridians are concerned for the future of our country, the future of their children and grandchildren. We have got to focus on getting Americans back to work and making the tough choices about spending so we can begin to pay off our continually mounting debt.” 

BACKGROUND: Senator LeMieux has introduced and supported several pieces of legislation to create jobs, help small businesses, and rein in out of control spending. In September, he co-authored the Small Business Lending Act, which cuts taxes for small businesses, frees up capital for community banks so they can lend to small business owners, and increases export promotion tools. That bill was signed into law on September 27, 2010.
