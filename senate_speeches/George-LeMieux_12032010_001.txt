WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator George LeMieux (R-FL) today hailed news that representatives of the U.S. And South Korea have reached agreement on a revised trade agreement. Once finalized, legislators in both countries must ratify it for the agreement to take effect.

“This agreement is long overdue. Increased trade increases job opportunities in Florida and across our country,” LeMieux said. “The President should have sent this agreement to Congress months ago. Instead, other countries have been able to take advantage of the global marketplace with their own trade agreements. I hope this agreement comes to Congress quickly and I urge my colleagues to approve it, as well as the other pending trade agreements with Colombia and Panama.”

South Korea is the United States’ seventh largest trading partner and eighth largest export market. In 2009, The U.S. exported nearly $30 billion worth of goods to South Korea.
