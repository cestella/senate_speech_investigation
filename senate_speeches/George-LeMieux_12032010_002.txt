WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator George LeMieux (R-FL) today called on the Cuban regime to release a U.S. citizen that was detained a year ago by Cuban authorities. U.S. citizen Alan Gross was detained on December 5th, 2009 while distributing cell phones, laptop computers and other communications equipment to Cuban citizens. Under the Castro regime, the Cuban people are supposedly allowed to own these communications devices. 
 
Senator LeMieux said:
 
“It has been a year since the Castro regime detained and imprisoned Mr. Gross and they have yet to file a single charge. Not only does this violate international law, it violates Cuba’s stated laws, which mandate that detainees must be charged with a crime within 90 days of their detention. I am concerned for the health and safety of Mr. Gross and call on the Cuban regime to immediately release him. I urge our Administration to take the necessary measures in order for the Cuban regime to understand that Alan’s incarceration is unacceptable and he must be released.” 
 
Mr. Gross worked for a non-government organization contracted by the State Department to supply computer and communications materials to civil society groups in Cuba.
