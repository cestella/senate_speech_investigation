WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator George LeMieux (R-FL) today issued a statement following his vote opposing the motion to table S. 3992, the DREAM bill.

Senator LeMieux said:

“I am very sympathetic to the young people who entered our country illegally by no fault of their own, but I will not support consideration of the DREAM Act without addressing border security. I recently visited the US-Mexico border in Arizona and witnessed the progress toward securing the border. Fully funding and replicating our security successes across the border would allow us to address the DREAM act. However, we are still far from achieving a level of border security that is acceptable to me or to the American people.”
