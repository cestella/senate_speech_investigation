WASHINGTON– U.S. Senator George LeMieux (R-FL) today announced Florida’s high speed rail corridor will receive an additional $342.3 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation. With this additional funding, the total federal portion amounts to $2.39 billion dollars.
  
“This continued support of the U.S. Department of Transportation is imperative for the success of the high speed rail project,” said LeMieux. “This additional funding underscores not only the national support, but also Florida’s commitment to bring better transportation solutions to the state. I look forward to the day when people can travel to and from the major city and university centers in Florida, creating a mega region.”
