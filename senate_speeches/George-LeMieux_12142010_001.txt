WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator George LeMieux (R-FL) today issued a statement in regards to the tax relief legislation currently pending in Congress.

Senator LeMieux said:

“Families in Florida and our nation continue to face severe economic challenges.  Voting against the tax relief bill would be a vote to raise taxes when our citizens are suffering and I will not saddle Floridians with the burden of higher taxes. The tax relief bill stops the January 1 tax hike and I intend to vote for it, but this compromise product is not without significant failings. In exchange for avoiding a tax increase, Washington’s politics-as-usual style of brokering has produced a bill that adds billions in deficit spending. Congress’ first order of business next session should be an across the board spending cap. Unless our Federal government’s spending is reined in, our national debt will threaten the prosperity of our people and the continuation of our Republic.”
