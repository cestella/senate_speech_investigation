(Washington) – U.S. Senator George LeMieux (R-FL) today called for a full and open debate on the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and an opportunity to amend the treaty and the resolution of ratification. The senator believes without a full debate and an amendment process, the Senate will not have given the treaty proper attention and consideration.  

Senator LeMieux said:

“What you're seeing here this week is further evidence that Congress is broken. To think we would take up the solemn responsibility of approving a nuclear weapons treaty with Russia and approve a 2,000 page, $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill is an injustice. I think every member of our conference wants to be in a position where they could support the START treaty, but it deserves fair treatment and that is a full and open debate and a process for amending the language.” 

BACKGROUND: The United States and Russia signed the new START—on April 8, 2010. This treaty is designed to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reductions Treaty, which expired, after 15 years of implementation, on December 5, 2009. The new START will enter into force when the U.S. Senate provides its advice and consent to ratification and the Russian Parliament approves the treaty. Treaties require 67 votes in the Senate for ratification.
