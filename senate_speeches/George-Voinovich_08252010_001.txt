WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-Ohio) released the following statement today on the death of William Saxbe:

“Bill Saxbe gave me my first job in government as the assistant attorney general of Ohio. He was an outstanding attorney general, and I enjoyed learning from his example. Bill’s legacy of leadership and service, and his distinction as a U.S. senator and U.S. ambassador to India will live on in our nation’s history. Bill served in government for the right reasons, and made a difference in the lives of Americans.

 “Janet and I are extremely saddened to hear of Bill’s passing. We always admired Bill and Dolly’s wonderful marriage; they lived life to the fullest and always enjoyed each other. Bill always kept things in perspective and achieved balance in his life. Janet and I would like to express our heartfelt sympathy to the Saxby family as they remain in our thoughts and prayers.”
