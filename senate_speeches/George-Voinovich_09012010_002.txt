WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-Ohio), ranking member of the Senate Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce and the District of Columbia subcommittee, today released the following statement regarding the 2010 Best Places to Work rankings issued by the Partnership for Public Service and American University’s Institute for the Study of Public Policy Implementation:

“For the past 12 years, I have focused on improving government management, especially in high-risk areas, and ensuring that the federal government has the right people with knowledge and skills at the right place at the right time to provide the necessary services for our nation. Since my election to the Senate in 1999, I’ve made it my mission to strengthen the quality of our government’s workforce – or what I like to call our ‘A-Team.’ Together with my colleague Sen. Daniel Akaka, I have passed legislation to provide key federal agencies such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Government Accountability Office, NASA, the intelligence community and the State Department with the flexibility they need to attract and retain the best and brightest.

“One need only look at the Best Places to Work rankings to see how these types of flexibilities can improve employee satisfaction. The fact that these agencies are currently ranked in the top 10 of the 2010 Best Places to Work survey shows that flexibilities, when properly implemented and communicated to employees, improve satisfaction and workforce commitment to mission.

“In these economic times, agencies must work harder and smarter and do more with less. The agencies featured at the top of the Best Places to Work survey are shining examples of agencies working with their employees to provide welcoming places to work and outstanding public services for taxpayers.”
