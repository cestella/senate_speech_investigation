WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-Ohio), the original author of the Securing America’s Future Economy (SAFE) Commission Act on which the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform was modeled, released the following statement today on the circulation of the “Co-Chairs’ Proposal:”

“Having spent nearly five years working to get Congress to enact a statutory commission to address our nation’s looming fiscal crisis, I am incredibly pleased that Sen. Simpson and Mr. Bowles have produced a bold roadmap for the other members of the executive order commission to use toward placing the United States on a fiscally sustainable course. While I have not yet had the opportunity to review the entire proposal, Sen. Simpson and Mr. Bowles assured me during our meetings that they were dead serious about their work and that I would be very pleased with their recommendations.

“It gives me a good measure of confidence that Maya MacGuineas has spoken so highly of this initial proposal. My work to restore fiscal sanity is a pivotal part of my legacy to my eight grandchildren, and I will see one of my brightest days if I have the opportunity to vote on the commission’s final recommendations before I leave the Senate at the end of this Congress.”
