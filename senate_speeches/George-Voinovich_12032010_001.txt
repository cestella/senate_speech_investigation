WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator George V. Voinovich (R-Ohio), the original author of the Securing America’s Future Economy (SAFE) Commission Act on which the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform was modeled, released the following statement today on the commission’s vote:

“Having spent nearly five years working to get Congress to enact a statutory commission to address our nation’s looming fiscal crisis, I congratulate the 11 members of the commission who voted in favor of sending the recommendations to the full Congress for consideration. I would particularly like to thank my Senate colleagues, Sens. Tom Coburn, Mike Crapo and Judd Gregg – as far as I am concerned, they and the others who voted yes are true patriots who had the courage to do what is right for our country’s domestic and national security and for the future of our children and grandchildren. 

“Our country’s fiscal house is on life support, and we cannot kick the can down the road any longer. I urge President Obama to use the commission’s proposals and work with House and Senate leadership to ensure this commission’s recommendations. This road map will provide the blueprint toward restoring our nation’s fiscal well being.”
