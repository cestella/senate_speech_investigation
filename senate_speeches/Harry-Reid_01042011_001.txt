Washington, D.C. –Nevada Senator Harry Reid issued the following statement on the one-year anniversary of the shooting at the Lloyd D. George Federal Courthouse that tragically claimed the life of Court Security Officer Stanley Cooper and wounded Deputy United States Marshal Richard J. “Joe” Gardner:

“Just a year ago, violence claimed the life of Stanley Cooper, a man who dedicated his life to protecting others every day. Joe Gardner was also wounded during the shooting that required quick, courageous action by all security personnel to prevent further fatalities and injuries.  It’s because of the heroic actions of Cooper and Gardner that we appreciate the sacrifice law enforcement personnel make every day to keep us safe. We are all grateful to Cooper, who made the ultimate sacrifice—a sacrifice that has not been—and will not be—forgotten. ”
