 Washington, D.C. – Nevada Senator Harry Reid today announced new opportunities for job creation in Nevada through clean energy projects after the Obama Administration identified seven areas in the state as “solar energy zones,” a designation that will improve and accelerate the permitting and siting process for solar energy development to proceed.  Such a designation will save money for developers, utilities and consumers. The announcement comes on the heels of the Secretaries of Energy and the Interior releasing a draft analysis that identifies public lands most suitable for large-scale, environmentally-sound solar energy production in six Western states.  
 
“I commend Secretary Salazar and the President for pushing forward with the responsible use of our public lands to grow solar power development that will create jobs in Nevada,” Reid said.  “Today’s announcement brings Nevada new prospects for clean energy jobs and moves us closer to energy independence.  These projects will help Nevada lead the nation in clean energy production and further diversify our economy.”
 
The seven zones identified in the study are: Amargosa Valley, Delamar Valley, Dry Lake, Dry Lake North Valley, East Mormon Mountain, Gold Point and Miller’s. Together, the zones comprise nearly 200,000 acres, which could produce several thousand megawatts of clean power.  The public will have 90 days to publicly comment on the study.
