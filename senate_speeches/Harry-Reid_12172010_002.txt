Washington, DC – Nevada Senator Harry Reid released the following statement on the tax relief legislation that President Barack Obama signed into law today:

“While this bill is not perfect, it will strengthen our economy by creating jobs and providing relief to Nevada’s families, small businesses and unemployed.  The tax relief package not only prevents a massive middle-class tax hike, it extends unemployment insurance, protects our sales tax deduction and will put more than 2,500 Nevadans back to work by developing our state’s renewable energy resources.”
