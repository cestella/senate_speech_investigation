 Washington, DC – On the same day that Nevada received an update on its unemployment rate, Republicans have spent the day bragging about killing the Omnibus Appropriations bill – legislation that would have created Nevada jobs and provided vital resources for Nevada’s military and law enforcement personnel, veterans, and senior citizens.  
 
Make no mistake about what happened last night: Republicans’ hypocrisy on earmarks caught up with them. They got caught with their hands in the cookie jar, requesting billions of dollars in earmarks in private, while publicly criticizing the bill. Once again, Republicans chose to play politics instead of doing one of most basic jobs they were sent to Washington to do: responsibly fund the government.

The result? Nevada lost out on jobs and resources because of Republican obstruction and political posturing.
 
The following is partial list of what Republicans are bragging about killing for Nevada:
