Washington, DC– Nevada Senator Harry Reid released the following statement after the Census Bureau announced Nevada will be represented by an additional member of the House of Representatives:

“Today’s announcement that our congressional delegation will grow by one can only make Nevada stronger. As a small state, we need to fight to ensure Nevada receives its fair share of resources to create jobs, improve its struggling education system and keep families in their homes. I am eager to work closely with this full slate of legislators to deliver for Nevada the way it deserves by putting people back to work and strengthening our economy.”
