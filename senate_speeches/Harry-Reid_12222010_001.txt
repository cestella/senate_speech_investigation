 Washington, DC—Nevada Senator Harry Reid released the following statement today following Senate passage of legislation to ensure health care for 9/11 heroes: 

“The patriots who rushed into burning buildings, saved lives and helped us rebuild from the rubble of 9/11 are genuine American heroes.  Today we ensured that those who developed serious or debilitating illness from their work on that day will get the care they need.  I appreciate the tenacious work of Senators Schumer and Gillibrand for leading the effort to pass this bill.    

“When America needed these men and women following the 9/11 attacks, they didn’t hesitate.  They did not complain about not having enough time. And we owed it to them to do the same.  

“These first responders went above and beyond the call of duty in our country’s hour of greatest need.  Just as they helped us recover from 9/11, we will take care of them. Today, Democrats led the effort to fulfill our promise to never forget these heroes.”
