 Washington, DC—Nevada Senator Harry Reid released the following statement today in reaction to the President signing the repeal of the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy into law this morning.  The Senate passed a repeal of the policy this past weekend: 

“Today, our military reflects who we are as a nation.  By repealing ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’ we showed that discrimination has no place in our military, just as it has no place in America.  In addition to ensuring that our military reflects our nation’s values, our military leadership has said that repealing this policy will make our armed forces stronger and more united.  

“I commend Chairman Levin, Senators Lieberman and Collins, and all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for leading passage of this landmark change in policy.  I am hopeful that our bipartisan work on this issue signals that Democrats and Republicans can continue to work together.”
