This is a proud moment for our armed forces who have spent seven years doing difficult and dangerous work in Iraq to protect our country and we owe them our thanks.  This is also an important step for the Iraqi people who are now fully responsible for their own future and security.  Now that the President has fulfilled his pledge to draw down our commitment in Iraq, we need to focus on successfully ending our involvement in Afghanistan and rebuilding our economy and creating jobs here at home.
