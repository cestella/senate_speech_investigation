WASHINGTON â€“ Today, U.S. Senator Herb Kohl announced $6.37 million in grant funding through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Management Assistance Program and the National Organic Certification Cost-Share Program. Producers seeking organic designation must be certified to ensure their production methods meet organic standards.  These funds help defray the cost of that certification. As Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, Kohl has oversight of the USDA budget.  

"The organic industry has been one of the fastest growing segments of the food industry over the last decade. Last year the organic industry totaled $26 billion in sales. That's why I worked to secure federal funding for a number of programs important to the organic industry to help build on this impressive growth," Kohl said.  

Kohl included $500,000 for the Organic Transition Program and $8.11 million for the National Organic Program in the Senate's FY2011 agriculture appropriations bill, which is pending Senate approval.  

According to the USDA's Economic Research Service, Wisconsin has 1016 certified organic producers which ranks second nationally. The state also ranks second in acres of certified organic cropland with 170,953 acres.
