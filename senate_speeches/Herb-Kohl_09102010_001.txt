"For years we have been prodding FDA and USDA, through the appropriations process, to strengthen food safety programs.  Our work has made it possible for the FDA to hire more inspectors, provide greater scrutiny of imports and bolster research.  These are all objectives we discussed when I hosted the FDA Commissioner in Madison several months ago. But the situation with salmonella in eggs points to a more fundamental reality â€“ money alone won't solve the problem.   Federal Agencies need new authorities to respond immediately to food safety threats.  The food safety bill moving through the Senate will for the first time give the FDA authority to issue mandatory recalls of tainted products.  It will also create a system where inspection resources are focused on the riskiest steps in food processes and clarify federal jurisdictions relating to food safety.  It is my hope that we can act on this bill when the Senate reconvenes in September."
