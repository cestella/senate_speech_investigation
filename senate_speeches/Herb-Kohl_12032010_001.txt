Today the President's Debt Commission took bold action to save our country from a looming debt crisis.  They have done outstanding work, and made some difficult decisions.  While I would not endorse everything included here, especially some of the cuts to Social Security, this is an important step to getting our fiscal house in order.  I have always been focused on reining in the deficit, and this is a good place to start for next year's budget debate.
