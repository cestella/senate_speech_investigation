WASHINGTON, DC â€“ Today, the Senate passed the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 which included provisions requested by Senator Kohl to authorize funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP).  The bill now goes back to the House for final approval before being sent to the President.

"The Manufacturing Extension Partnership program is a proven job creator in Wisconsin and across the nation.  This is a commonsense investment in our small and medium-sized manufacturers that will lead to Wisconsin companies being more competitive, more profitable, and most importantly, saving and creating jobs."                

The Senate-version of the bill passed today contained provisions from Senator Kohl's bill (S.3523).  Senator Kohl's bill authorized $825 million for the MEP base program over five years.  The bill passed by the Senate today authorizes more than $460 million over three years for the MEP, funding levels nearly-identical to the Kohl bill.

Senator Kohl has long championed the MEP program for its success in ensuring major Wisconsin employers can compete in the global market. In June, Senator Kohl introduced legislation to reauthorize funding for the MEP program through Fiscal Year 2015. Wisconsin is home to two MEP Centers, and in the last year, Wisconsin companies that worked with the two centers were able to save or create more than 1,200 jobs, generate $118 million in sales, make $35.8 million in new investments, and generate $37.3 million in cost savings.

The MEP, through its centers, provides technical assistance and business consultation to small- and medium-sized manufacturers, enabling them to enhance productivity and competitiveness.  Specifically, MEP centers help these employers to adopt upgraded, state-of-the-art technology, streamline internal and production processes, identify cost inefficiencies, train workers to adapt to every-changing technological environment.
