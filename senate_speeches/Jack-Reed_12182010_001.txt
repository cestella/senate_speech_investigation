WASHINGTON, DC - Today, Senate Republicans once again blocked the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, which would give bright, hardworking immigrant students an opportunity to earn legal status.  Under the DREAM Act, students would be eligible to apply for legal status if they were brought to the U.S. before their 16th birthday, lived continuously in the U.S. since at least 2005, graduated from high school, passed a background check, and completed at least two years of college or military service in good standing.
 U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), a staunch supporter for the DREAM Act, vowed to keep working for passage of the bill and toward comprehensive immigration reform:
 “In the past we’ve had bipartisan support for the DREAM Act because it is clearly beneficial to our economy, our Armed Forces, and our nation.
 “But today, Republicans voted in lockstep to prevent thousands of young people from realizing their dreams of going to college and serving the only country they know and love.
 “Our military leaders support this bill because it will improve military readiness by expanding the pool of high-achieving young people who can serve.
 “Our business leaders support it because it will enable them to hire more talented, bilingual, and multicultural workers that can help America compete in the global economy.
 “Giving these young people the chance to earn legal status by going to college or serving in the military will strengthen our communities and our economy.
 “We don’t punish children for the sins of their parents, and we should be encouraging young people who want to serve instead of discouraging them.
 “I will continue to fight for passage of the DREAM Act.”
