U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), today released the following statement commemorating the ninth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.:

“Nine years ago our nation faced tragedy as thousands of innocent lives were lost at the hands of terrorists. Today, we pause to remember that horrific September day and pray for the families who lost their loved ones. Although the scars of 9/11 are forever imprinted in the heart of every American, let us never forget the strong resolve that united citizens from across the country. To our brave first responders and service men and women who answered the call of duty nine years ago, we are humbled by your selfless sacrifice and forever indebted to your service. Now, as our men and women in uniform continue to protect our nation, we remain grateful for their dedication to ensure our nation remains free. Today, my thoughts and prayers are with the families who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001.”
