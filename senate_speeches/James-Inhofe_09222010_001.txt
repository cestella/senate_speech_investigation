Today, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) awarded U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) with the Guardian of Small Business Award for his outstanding voting record on behalf of America’s small business owners in the 111th Congress. Inhofe has consistently received this award since being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996.

“I am honored to receive the Guardian of Small Business Award from the National Federation of Independent Business,” said Inhofe. “As our nation continues to recover from a recession, my priority remains to support small businesses that represent the value of free enterprise and provide quality service. Many of the policies pursued by President Obama and the Democrat controlled Congress are attacks on job creating small businesses and the many institutions that make America different.  As a nation, we must get back to free market principles and get people back to work.”

NFIB President Dan Danner said, “In the 111th Congress, Senator Inhofe proved that he is a champion of small business. The Guardian of Small Business Award is a token of the deep appreciation that small business owners have for elected officials who promote and protect their right to own, operate and grow their businesses.”
