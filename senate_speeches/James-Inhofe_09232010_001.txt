Today, U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) received an “A” rating from the National Tax Limitation Committee (NTLC). In recognition of his fiscally conservative voting record, NTLC has announced that Inhofe is a recipient of the 111th Congress Tax Fighter Award. This award is presented annually to Members of Congress who consistently exercise fiscal restraint and protect American taxpayers from wasteful federal spending.

“I am honored to receive this award, and I will continue my commitment to end wasteful spending in Washington while standing up for the American taxpayer,” said Inhofe.  “The National Tax Limitation Committee is an organization that tirelessly advocates for responsible fiscal legislation. Currently, our federal government is in desperate need of fiscal restraint as the liberal majority continues to burden Americans with irresponsible legislation that only increases our nation’s federal spending, taxes, and debt.”

NTLC President Lewis K. Uhler said, “Senator Inhofe has led the battle on behalf of  taxpayers to stop the passage of ObamaCare and cap-and-trade legislation, to make the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, to eliminate the death tax, to kill the Alternative Minimum Tax, to provide incentives for private savings, investment and job creation and to control the growth of federal spending.

Uhler continued, “Senator Inhofe has been a major asset to taxpayers across America during his congressional service, having earned the Tax Fighter Award consistently in every session of Congress. He has had the courage to challenge the orthodoxy of Washington spending and earmarks.”
