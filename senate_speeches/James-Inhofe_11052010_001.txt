U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), made the following statement on the one year anniversary of the shooting at Fort Hood:

“Today, my thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims and our brave men and women in uniform.  Their selfless service and sacrifices protect this nation and its people from those who wish us harm and our way of life.  Whether in some distant land or right here at home, we must never forget the fact that our men and women in uniform are constantly on the front lines to defend our freedoms.  We must continue to stay vigilant and provide our military with the training, equipment and authorities they require to ensure this type of attack never occur again.”
