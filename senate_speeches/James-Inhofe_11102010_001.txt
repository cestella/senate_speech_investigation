U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), today made the following statement to commemorate the 235th birthday of the United States Marine Corps:

“Today, we honor the tens of thousands of Marines who have sacrificed their lives to preserve our nation’s freedom. From clearing operations in Marjah, Afghanistan to Hurricane Tomas damage assessment and relief efforts in Haiti, deployed United States Marines have always remain committed to the multifaceted missions they are given. The Marine Corps have a long history in Oklahoma and I am proud of their service across the state including Fort Sill and Vance Air Force Base.  On the 235th birthday of the United States Marine Corps, I salute every member in uniform for remaining faithful to the principles of liberty. Their tremendous work in making the world a safer place is invaluable and for this we owe a debt of gratitude.”
