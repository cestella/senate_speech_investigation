Today, U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), made the following statement to honor veterans as the nation observes Veterans Day:

“Throughout the course of our nation’s history, our brave servicemen and women have selflessly dedicated their lives to preserve our freedom. Today, this statement holds true as thousands of men and women in uniform serve at home and in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan in order to defend the strongholds of our nation’s democracy. For this, we as a nation are forever humbled and grateful for their continued service to keep our nation and its citizens safe.”

“With its change in 1954 from Armstice Day, Veterans Day has become a symbolic date for the country to remember those of our Armed Forces who have defended our great country. Veterans Day is emblematic of our Nation’s commitment to those who have served and I strongly believe that we owe these individuals a debt of gratitude well beyond a special day of remembrance. As the second ranking of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a long time champion for those in uniform, I will continue to push for the best equipment, training and benefits that these men and women justly deserve. As the new Congress forms in the coming months, be assured that the care of our nation’s Armed Forces and Veterans will remain at the top of my agenda. God Bless our Armed Forces and God Bless this great nation.”
