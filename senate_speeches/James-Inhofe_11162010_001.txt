U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC), today agreed with Republican Whip U.S. Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) that the START treaty should not be taken up in the lame duck session.
 
“It’s time to start over with START,” Inhofe said.  “I welcome Senator Kyl’s definitive statement that the START treaty should not be considered in the lame duck session.  Historically, no major nuclear arms control treaty has ever been taken up in a lame duck, and, as I have pointed out repeatedly, the one-sided nature of the hearings before the Senate has not begun to adequately examine this treaty’s ramifications.  I look forward to the 112th  Congress where a more balanced set of hearings may be scheduled before both the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees.”
     
Inhofe added, “With this treaty, we are focusing on the wrong country regarding the efforts to stop nuclear proliferation and its direct threat to American security.  We need to focus our diplomatic and military efforts instead on the threats posed by countries like Iran, North Korea, Syria and China.”
 
Inhofe continued, “When analyzed together, the Preamble, Russian Unilateral Statement, and specific pronouncements by Russian officials like Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, strongly suggest that the START treaty limits our nation’s ability to develop and deploy a missile defense system for our country and allies while at the same time reduces our nuclear stockpile without ensuring modernization of our nuclear triad and supporting infrastructure.  Further inquiry is necessary in order for the Senate to fulfill its ‘advise and consent’ obligation under our Constitution when reviewing treaties for ratification.”
