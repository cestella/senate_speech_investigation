U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), made the following statement after attending a SASC hearing to consider the nomination of U.S. Gen. Carter Ham as Commander of the United States Africa Commander (AFRICOM):

“General Ham possesses a commendable military record,” said Inhofe.  “I believe we share the same passion to continue developing the continent of Africa by working alongside Africans in order to build their ability in preparedness and response to security issues, humanitarian crises, and development in governess and economy.” 

Inhofe continued, “Throughout the hearing, I appreciated General Ham’s commitment to find a solution to defeat Joseph Kony and the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA).  Having visited the continent of Africa on many occasions, I have seen firsthand the devastation caused by the LRA. Because of this, I have become involved in trying to prevent the further abduction and murder of children at the hands of Kony and his LRA.”
