U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), a long-time proponent of trying terrorist detainees currently held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (GITMO) under the military tribunal system, today blasted the Obama administration for nearly letting terrorist Ahmed Ghailani go free.
 
“While I am thankful that our civilian court system was able to convict Ghailani on one of the 285 charges brought against him, the fact remains that the Obama Administration's rejection of our military tribunal system nearly allowed this terrorist to get away,” Inhofe said.  “The results of this trial highlight the truth that the prosecution of terrorists detainees belongs in a military tribunal not because it ensures a particular result, but because it is the best way to present classified information and present evidence that has been taken from the battle field.  Within the military tribunal system, terrorist do not need to have their Miranda Rights read to them when captured, and obtaining a warrant on the front lines of the war is not necessary.”
 
“It has long been my concern that terrorists could more easily circumvent justice with President Obama and Attorney General Holder pushing for civilian trials.  Despite their assurances and empty promises of the civilian court system’s ability to handle these cases, this trial clearly shows that the proper place to try terrorists is through the military tribunal system.  Make no mistake:  these are enemy combatants not common criminals.”
