 U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), who served as Tulsa’s mayor from 1978 to 1984, today expressed disappointment with event organizers who for the second year have taken word “Christmas” out of the Christmas Parade of Lights.  The event’s name was changed last year to Holiday Parade of Lights. 
 
“I have participated virtually every year for decades in Tulsa’s Christmas Parade of Lights, riding horseback as my children and grandchildren watched,” Inhofe said.  “I did not do so last year, because I’m not going to ride in a Christmas parade that doesn’t recognize Christmas.  Last year, the forces of political correctness removed the word ‘Christmas’ and replaced it with ‘Holiday’ instead.  I am deeply saddened and disappointed by this change.  I am hopeful that the good people of Tulsa and the city’s leadership will demand a correction to this shameful attempt to take Christ, the true reason for our celebration, out of the parade’s title.  Until the parade is again named the Christmas Parade of Lights, I will not participate.”
