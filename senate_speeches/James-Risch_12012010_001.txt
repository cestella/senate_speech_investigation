Washington, DC—U.S. Senator Jim Risch released the following statement today regarding the letter delivered to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on what the legislative priorities should be for the remainder of the 111th Congress. The letter states that Risch and all 41 other Republican Senators will not move to consider other legislation until Congress acts to fund the government and prevent the tax increase that is currently awaiting all American taxpayers.

“Last month, the American people voiced their priorities with their votes at the polls. With just a few weeks remaining, Congress still has not done anything to fix government’s borrow-and-spend habits. Nor has any significant work taken place to prevent the impending tax increase that will hit all taxpayers at year’s end. It is long past time we focus on getting Americans back to work and our deficit spending stopped. That’s what Americans voted for last month.”
