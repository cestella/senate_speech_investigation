(Washington, D.C.) - U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen today released the statement below following the confirmation of Linda Dalianis as the Chief Justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court.  Dalianis became the first woman to join the New Hampshire Supreme Court when she was appointed by then-Governor Shaheen in 2000.

"As the first woman to join the state's Supreme Court, Justice Linda Dalianis has established herself as a role model.  Breaking such barriers can be challenging and this new position further cements her place as a pioneer."

"Her independent and thoughtful approach to the law is what led me to appoint her in 2000. I am confident she will lead the New Hampshire Supreme Court with distinction and integrity."
