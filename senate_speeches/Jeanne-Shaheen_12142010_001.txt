(Washington, D.C.) - U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen released the following statement today regarding the tax compromise currently under debate in the U.S. Senate:

"Middle class families and small businesses across the state have told me that they need tax relief in this still-fragile economy, and I am hopeful that the middle-class tax cuts, the extension of unemployment benefits, and the targeted tax cuts for businesses will help stimulate economic growth and create much needed jobs. I am disappointed that this package includes tax cuts for the wealthy that our country cannot afford given our unsustainable deficits and the need to reduce our debt.  However, I have decided to support this compromise to continue the economic recovery and keep middle class taxes low."
