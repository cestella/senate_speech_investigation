Washington, D.C.  – The Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010, a bill introduced by Oregon’s Senator Jeff Merkley with Senators Jon Kyl (R-AZ) and Richard Burr (R-NC), passed the Senate unanimously Friday evening and will now to go President Obama’s desk to be signed into law.  The bipartisan bill criminalizes the creation, sale, distribution, advertising, marketing, and exchange of animal crush videos.

“These crush videos are deplorable depictions of the torture and killing of animals and have no place in American society,” Merkley said.  “I’m proud that we were able to send a bill to the president that successfully protects both animals and free speech.”

Crush videos are sexual fetish videos of women mutilating small animals with their feet.  A 2009 Supreme Court decision ruled that a previous law banning sale of the videos was overly broad. 

A version of the bill previously passed the Senate in September, but slight changes were made in the version approved by the House of Representatives.  The penalty for violations of the measure would be up to seven years in prison.
