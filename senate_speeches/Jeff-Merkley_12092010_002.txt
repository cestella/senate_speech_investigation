Washington, D.C.  – President Barack Obama today signed into law the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010.  The bill was introduced by Oregon’s Senator Jeff Merkley with Senators Jon Kyl (R-AZ) and Richard Burr (R-NC), and passed the Senate unanimously last month.  Merkley joined President Obama in the Oval Office today for the official signing ceremony.  The bipartisan bill criminalizes the creation, sale, distribution, advertising, marketing, and exchange of animal crush videos.

“Today marks a victory against the cruel torture and killing of animals,” Merkley said.  “By cracking down on the creation and distribution of crush videos, this bipartisan law effectively protects both animals and free speech.”

Crush videos are videos that depict people mutilating small animals with their feet.  A 2009 Supreme Court decision ruled that a previous law banning sale of the videos was overly broad.

The penalty for violations of the measure would be up to seven years in prison.
