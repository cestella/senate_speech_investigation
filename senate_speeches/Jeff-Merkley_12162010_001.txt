Portland, OR – Oregon Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden today announced that the U.S. Department of Energy has finalized a $1.3 billion loan guarantee for the Shepherds Flat wind farm in Eastern Oregon. This financing will help support the completion of the world’s largest wind farm and will help create hundreds of jobs in Eastern Oregon and avoid over 1.2 million tons of air pollution per year.

“This is a great holiday gift for Eastern Oregon and it couldn’t come at a better time,” said Merkley. “This financing from the U.S. Department of Energy will help put people back to work and continue Oregon’s reputation as a clean energy leader.“
“This loan guarantee helps insure that this project will be built, that jobs will be created, that the Oregon economy will benefit and that the United States will be another step closer to energy independence,” Wyden said. “When it is completed, Shepherds Flat will be one of the largest windmill farms in the world and will put Oregon on the map as a leader in green energy.”
“Renewable energy investments like these are creating jobs while helping to maintain America’s global competitiveness in the clean energy economy,” said U.S Department of Energy Secretary Steven Chu.  “By leveraging our nation’s vast natural resources, we can help provide alternative sources of energy and stimulate economic growth and job creation.”
The 845-megawatt wind generation facility will be located in Gilliam and Morrow counties and is sponsored by Caithness Energy, LLC and GE Energy Financial Services. The $1.3 billion loan guarantee is one of 16 clean energy projects that have been approved by the U.S. Department of Energy.
