WASHINGTON—U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the following comments today about the nomination of Charles Andrews to be U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of Alabama:

“I have known and worked with Major Andrews for many years. As Chief of the Highway Patrol Division for the Alabama Department of Public Safety, Major Andrews has the experience and background to handle this important office. I am pleased that President Obama has made this nomination, and I congratulate Major Andrews on the opportunity to continue his public service to Alabama as a United States Marshal.”

A native of Monroe County, Andrews graduated from the University of Alabama in 1977 with a degree in criminal justice, and worked for several years as a correctional counselor prior to joining the Department of Public Safety in 1980.

His nomination will be reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee and, if approved, be sent to the full Senate for consideration. If confirmed, Andrews will replace William Taylor, who has served as U.S. Marshal for Alabama’s Southern District since 2002.

The Southern District encompasses 13 counties in Alabama: Baldwin, Choctaw, Clarke, Conecuh, Dallas, Escambia, Hale, Marengo, Mobile, Monroe, Perry, Washington, and Wilcox.
