WASHINGTON–U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued a statement today following the passage of provisions that allow the Secretary of the Navy to award contracts for up to 20 Littoral Combat Ships:

“The Navy and Secretary Mabus have done an outstanding job in negotiating with the contractors to purchase more ships at no additional cost to the taxpayer. As a result of Secretary Mabus and the Navy’s success in gaining Congressional approval for this new acquisition strategy, thousands of new jobs will be created at Austal USA in Mobile, Alabama and at Marinette Marine in Marinette, Wisconsin. This new acquisition strategy saves money and increases the size of the Navy’s fleet faster. I am grateful to my colleagues in the Senate for including this important provision for the Littoral Combat Ship in the Continuing Resolution.”

The LCS provision was included in the Continuing Resolution, which overwhelmingly passed the Senate by a vote of 79 to 16. It is expected to pass the House later tonight.
