Today, U.S. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina), a member of the Joint Economic Committee and chairman of the Senate Steering Committee, made the following statement in response to news that the national unemployment rate climbed to 9.6 percent. 

"Today’s unemployment news is further proof that President Obama’s reckless spending agenda is taking our nation in the wrong direction,” said Senator DeMint. “When Democrats took control of Congress nearly four years ago, unemployment was less than 5 percent. Now that the Democrats have added trillions to our national debt, unemployment has more than doubled and millions of Americans have lost their jobs.  The Democrats' experiment with socialism must end: government spending, debt and takeovers will not put Americans back to work.  It's time to fire Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and rebuild a free market economy that works for Americans."

“Instead of repeating the same big government mistakes that led us to nearly 10 percent unemployment, we should pass commonsense solutions we know will work. We must stop the Obama tax hikes set to hit American families and businesses at the end of the year, repeal Obamacare, and balance the budget by cutting spending.” 

After Democrats took control of Congress in January 2007 the national unemployment rate was 4.6 percent. When President Obama signed the spending stimulus into law in February 2009, the national unemployment rate was 8.2 percent.
