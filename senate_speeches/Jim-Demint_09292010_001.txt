Today, U.S. Senator Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina), chairman of the Senate Steering Committee, announced the Senate will vote on his amendment to extend the continuing resolution to keep government operations funded from December 3, 2010 to February 4, 2011.


“This amendment will ensure that Democrats can’t threaten a government shutdown after the elections to force the Senate to swallow a bloated omnibus spending bill bursting at the seams with earmarks and deficit spending,” said Senator DeMint.  “We shouldn’t let a flock of lame duck legislators – who’ve been rejected at the ballot box and can never be held accountable again – to burden our children with a mountain of new debt,” said Senator DeMint.
