Today, U.S. Senator Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina), chairman of the Senate Steering Committee, made the following statement in applauding U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnellâ€™s (R-Kentucky) statement in support of the Senate Republican Conference earmark moratorium for the 112th Congress.

"Senator McConnell's support for the earmark moratorium demonstrates the kind of bold leadership our party needs," said Senator DeMint. "His statement today and tomorrow's vote to enact the moratorium will send a clear signal to voters that Republicans heard the message of the last election. I am proud that House and Senate Republicans have united to end the earmark favor factory. Earmarks have greased the skids for runaway spending and bad policy for decades. It's time for Congress to stop focusing on parochial pet projects, and instead focus on cutting spending, devolving power and decisions back to states, and working on national priorities like entitlement and tax reform. Now that Republicans are taking real action to end wasteful spending, I hope President Obama follows through with his rhetoric and promises to veto any bill with Democrat earmarks."
