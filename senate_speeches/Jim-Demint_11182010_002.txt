Today, U.S. Senator Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina) was renamed the chairman and U.S. Senator Tom Coburn (R-Oklahoma) was named vice chairman of the Senate Steering Committee, a caucus of conservative senators that includes the majority of the Republican Conference.
“I’m honored to continue to lead the historic Steering Committee and it’s a privilege to serve with Dr. Coburn,” said Senator DeMint. “Tom is one of the country’s most respected conservative leaders and a passionate advocate for limited government. With Dr. Coburn’s help, the Steering Committee will continue to play a pivotal role in the Senate by championing fiscal restraint, limited government, strong national security and traditional values. We will continue to discuss and promote conservative policies and will work with members of either party who are willing to help reduce our debt, expand free markets, and protect our Constitution.”

“The greatest challenge facing our nation today is our national debt and a Congress that has refused to rein in out-of-control spending,” said Dr. Coburn.  “I’m hopeful the Steering Committee will help provide the kind of leadership the Senate, and our country, needs at this critical time.  I’m pleased to work with Senator DeMint who has brought innovative and specific solutions to the table.  We need every member to do the same.”

Established in 1974, the nonpartisan committee provides a forum in which senators can work together to discuss and promote conservative legislation and policies.

Past Senate Steering Committee Chairmen include Senators Carl Curtis (R-Nebraska), James McClure (R-Idaho), Jesse Helms (R-North Carolina), Malcom Wallop (R-Wyoming), Phil Gramm (R-Texas), Jon Kyl (R-Arizona), and Jeff Sessions (R-Alabama).
