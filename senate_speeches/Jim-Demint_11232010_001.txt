U.S. Senator Jim DeMint has honored Ray Godwin and Laura Beauvais-Godwin of Greenville, S.C with the 2010 Angels in Adoption Award in recognition of their commitment to the adoption cause. 
 
The Godwins are the proud parents of two adopted daughters, and Ray began his adoption law practice after the adoption of the Godwins’ eldest daughter.  He continues to have a full-time adoption practice in Greenville. In 1998, Laura founded a South Carolina adoption agency that has since merged with Nightlight Christian Adoptions. She now leads other adoption and orphan care organizations, including the South Carolina Association of Licensed Adoption Agencies and the Carolina Christian Alliance for Orphans. The Godwins are the authors of The Complete Adoption Book.

“Ray and Laura are tireless advocates who continually work to improve the lives of children through adoption,” said DeMint. “Their own family is a personal testament to the miracle of adoption, and their experience has led them to dedicate their lives to increasing adoption awareness and helping children find loving homes.”
