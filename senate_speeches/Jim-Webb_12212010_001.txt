Following House passage today, legislation co-sponsored by Senator Jim Webb to increase the use of clean diesel technologies goes to the President for his signature.  The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2010 (DERA) extends the 2005 DERA program by five years. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that every $1 spent on clean diesel projects produces up to $13 of public health benefits, making DERA one of the most cost-effective federal programs.
 
The DERA reauthorization will continue to fund the modernization of the old diesel fleet in the United States by providing cleaner, more efficient diesel retrofits. Every year, DERA helps clean up more than 14,000 diesel-powered vehicles and equipment, reducing harmful emissions while employing thousands of workers who manufacture, sell or repair diesel vehicles and their components.

“Diesel engines are a leading source of the air pollution that threatens the health of our citizens,” said Senator Webb.  “Diesel emissions are also a major source of black carbon pollution—a significant contributor to global climate change. We have the technology to combat the problem; incentivizing cleaner diesel technologies will help address these concerns while simultaneously improving public health.”
 
The bipartisan bill, introduced by Senator George Voinovich (R-OH), unanimously passed the Senate last Thursday. A broad coalition of more than 530 environmental, public, industry and labor groups support it.
