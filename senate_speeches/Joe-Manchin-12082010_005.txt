Senator Joe Manchin today released the following statement regarding today’s votes on tax cuts:
 
“Today's votes are another sign that there is much more work to be done to bridge the divide between Republicans and Democrats. I plan to do everything in my power to help bridge that divide.
 
“While I have said repeatedly I prefer all the tax cuts be extended, I was open to a common sense compromise that would extend the cuts to those who make up to $1 million - or 99.9 percent of West Virginians. Unfortunately, that did not happen.
 
“In the remaining days, I will work with both Republicans and Democrats to help reach a bipartisan solution that ensures taxes do not go up on January 1, 2011. It is my hope, for the sake of the country and our fragile economy, that we can all put politics aside and get this done.”
 
 
Additional Background Regarding Taxes:
 
According to the West Virginia State Tax Department, in 2008, of the 759,636 personal income tax returns filed in West Virginia, only 573 or 0.1 percent were in the $1 million or more group.
 
According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, of the more than 161 million income tax returns filed nationwide, 315,000 or .2 percent were from people making more than $1 million.
