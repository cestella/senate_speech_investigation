Sen. Joe Manchin today released the following statement regarding the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act:
 
“While sympathetic to those who passionately support it, I cannot support the DREAM Act, as is, at this time.
 
“I strongly believe the DREAM Act should require the completion of a degree. As currently written, the legislation does not. Requiring the completion of a degree is exactly what the DREAM Act should be about, as it will help ensure that the young people who qualify have a real chance to fulfill the American Dream and become the productive citizens they aspire to be.
 
"In fact, I've had sincere discussions with my fellow senators and committee staff as to whether it would be possible to change the legislation to address my concerns. At this time, it is not.
 
“All that being said, I do believe, as most Americans do, that our immigration system is broken and must be fixed. During the next session of Congress, I sincerely hope to work with my Republican and Democratic colleagues to achieve true comprehensive immigration reform."
