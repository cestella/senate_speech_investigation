Sen. Joe Manchin today released the following statement applauding the passage of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START):
 
“After many months of negotiations, numerous public hearings and extended debate in the Senate, I am pleased that the Senate approved the New START Treaty today in a strong bipartisan fashion.
 
“I voted for the agreement, because I believe we must do everything in our power to keep the American people safe, and the ratification of this important arms-control treaty reestablishes communications, access and cooperation between United States and Russia - two countries that account for about 90 percent of all nuclear weapons.”  
 
Additional Background Information Regarding the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START):
         New START provides the U.S. and Russia with seven years to reduce their nuclear arsenal, and the treaty will remain in force for a total of 10 years.
 
         New START does not limit current or planned U.S. missile defense programs.
 
         The treaty has a verification regime that combines the appropriate elements of the 1991 START Treaty with new elements tailored to the limitations of the treaty. Measures under the treaty include on-site inspections and exhibitions, data exchanges and notifications related to strategic offensive arms and facilities covered by the treaty and provisions to facilitate the use of national technical means for treaty monitoring. To increase confidence and transparency, the treaty also provides for the exchange of telemetry.
