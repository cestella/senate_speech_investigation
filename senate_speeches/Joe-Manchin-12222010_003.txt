Sen. Joe Manchin released the following statement after Congress passed the 2011 Defense Authorization bill by unanimous consent earlier today:
 
“I am pleased the Fiscal Year 2011 Defense Authorization bill passed Congress with unanimous support. This legislation endorses better pay and benefits for our all-volunteer active duty and reserve forces, gives our military the tools needed to effectively pursue their mission at home and abroad, ends troubled defense programs and promotes better oversight of taxpayer dollars.”
