Following a news report in which the U.S. Department of Justice touted its enforcement of the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act in the weeks before the mid-term elections, U.S. Senator John Cornyn issued the following statement:

“It is outrageous that the Department of Justice would solicit congratulation for procrastination, while many of our military voters are very likely being disenfranchised.  The department should have been more proactive much earlier, by giving each state clear guidance on the new requirements under the MOVE Act and by ensuring from the start that each state had a satisfactory game plan for protecting the voting rights of our troops and their families.  Instead, the department sat back and watched as states tested the limits of the MOVE Act, then tried to patch problems after the fact with half-measures.  Our military voters deserve better than this lethargic approach from the Department of Justice.”
