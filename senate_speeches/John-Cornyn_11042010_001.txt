U.S. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) today issued the following statement in advance of the first anniversary of the shooting at Fort Hood: 

“Today we pause to honor the 13 killed, the many wounded and countless others affected by the senseless, violent attack at Fort Hood one year ago. My thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones who are still struggling to cope with this tragedy and loss, as well as the greater Fort Hood community as they honor those lost and the heroes who put themselves in harm’s way on that fateful day.

“As the largest military installation in the free world, Fort Hood has long been a source of pride for Texans and all Americans. I am pleased to see today that this fine post and the community that supports it have rallied together and emerged even stronger following last year’s tragedy.

“Today’s anniversary is also a solemn reminder that our nation faces enemies of all kinds who are driven by a common hatred for our freedoms and way of life. For that reason, we must continue to stand strong against terrorism, united behind our troops and intelligence community, and committed to defending our freedoms wherever they are threatened.”
