U.S. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) today encouraged President Obama to move forward on ratifying several free trade agreements proposed during the Bush Administration and long delayed in Congress:

“As the President promotes more robust trade with India, and has indicated he plans to move forward on our trade pact with South Korea, I hope this signals similar action on stalled agreements with Colombia and Panama.

“For too long President Obama and Democrat leaders in Congress have allowed these agreements to languish, shutting the doors to fertile markets for American products and preventing key partnerships with Latin American neighbors to strengthen and progress.

“As he visits India and other Asian nations and sees firsthand the benefits of free trade, I hope the President will not forget similar opportunities in Latin America to grow our economy and spur job creation. I would encourage him to work with House Republicans to approve these agreements quickly, and am hopeful the Senate can follow suit.”
