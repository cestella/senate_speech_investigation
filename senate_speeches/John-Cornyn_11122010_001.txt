“It is Resolved by the United States Senate Republican Conference:

(1)   That a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution is necessary to restore fiscal discipline to our Republic;

(2)   That a Balanced Budget Amendment should require the President to submit to Congress a proposed budget prior to each fiscal year in which total federal spending does not exceed total federal revenue;

(3)   That a Balanced Budget Amendment should include a requirement that a supermajority of both houses of Congress be necessary to increase taxes;

(4)   That a Balanced Budget Amendment should include a limitation on total federal spending.”
Thank you for protecting our rights on this important matter.
