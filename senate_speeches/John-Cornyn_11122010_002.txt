U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) today released the following statement in honor of Veteran’s Day:

“Veterans’ Day gives all Americans the chance to reflect on the selfless service and unbending patriotism of those who have worn our nation’s military uniform.  Because of their valor and willingness to stand in harm’s way to protect their fellow citizens, liberty and democracy stand strong in the United States.  Today, I’m humbled to join all Texans in honoring our brave veterans and thanking them for answering the call to serve.”
