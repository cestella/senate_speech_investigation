During today’s Republican Conference meeting, U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) hailed the unanimous passage of the resolution he introduced that calls for a Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) to the U.S. Constitution. Senator Cornyn also cosponsored and supported a resolution calling for a Republican moratorium on earmarks.

“The American people have spoken, and Republicans have listened. I implore my Democratic colleagues to join us in our effort to restore fiscal sanity to Washington and make a Balanced Budget Amendment the law of the land,” said Senator Cornyn. “The American people want Democrats and Republicans to work together, and I can think of no better way to tell them ‘message received’ than all one hundred senators kicking off the new Congress unanimously voting to adopt a Balanced Budget Amendment.”

Cornyn was joined by several co-sponsors including Senators Jim DeMint (R-SC), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Jeff Sessions (R-AL), David Vitter (R-LA), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), John Ensign (R-NV), Scott Brown (R-MA), Susan Collins (R-ME), and John Thune (R-SD), and Senators-elect Rand Paul (R-KY), Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Roy Blunt (R-MO), and Mike Lee (R-UT) in submitting his BBA resolution to the Senate Republican Conference.  The resolution states that the balanced budget amendment should require the President to submit a balanced budget every year to Congress, a supermajority vote to increase taxes on the American people, and impose a limitation on federal spending.
