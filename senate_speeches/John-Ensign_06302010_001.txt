Mr. President, allow me the opportunity to throw out a few numbers which I will explain in just a minute.  $30 billion. $200 billion.  $13 trillion.  $114,000.  60% of GDP.  To many Americans these numbers are just that, numbers with no real meaning to them.  Unfortunately, the same can be said for many here in the Senate too.  These are just simple numbers without consequence.  Nothing could be further from the truth. These five numbers are markers along the road to fiscal catastrophe that we are heading down at full speed.  These five numbers together are symbols of a great threat to the stability of our country both today and in the future.

$30 billion.  A lot has been said on the issue of extending unemployment benefits.  And while this issue has become one of political fodder and partisanship, the facts on this issue have been left out in favor of high-strung rhetoric and political opportunity.  Let me take a moment to explain to my constituents the real debate on this issue.  I, along with my Republican colleagues, believe that extending these benefits for the unemployed should be a top priority here in the Senate.  I know that we can pay to extend these benefits now by cutting spending in other areas and redirecting some stimulus funds, which have had little impact on the economy in my state and across the country. 

Despite what some of my other colleagues may say here on the floor, there is no debate on extending benefits for those who have fallen victim to our downturned economy.  The debate on this issue actually lies with the fact that those on the other side of the aisle would like to take the easy way out and avoid paying for this important legislation by passing another $30 billion onto our record-breaking national debt.  I know that $30 billion is just another number to those on the other side of the aisle, but it’s one that could easily be paid for now by their own policy of “pay as you go.”  Each time that the Senate has proceeded to vote on extending unemployment benefits, members in this body have had two options.  They have had the Democrat option of extending these benefits without paying for them.  And they have had the Republican option of not only extending vital unemployment benefits, but also paying to do so at the same time to protect the future of our country.  Democrats have voted against these common-sense proposals each time.  Six times to be exact.

Let me make that more clear: Democrats have voted against paying for the unemployment extension six times.  Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time that those on the other side of the aisle have gone against their own policy of ‘Pay-Go’, but it is the first time that they have hurt thousands of Americans in doing so.

I mentioned the number $200 billion earlier; this number represents the amount of spending that has violated the Democrats’ Pay-Go fiscal policy.  Four months ago, the Democrats decided to heed the warnings of many here, including me, who said that we were literally bankrupting the future of our country with the amount of national debt that we were passing down to our children and grandchildren.  They came up with a policy that would mandate paying for their spending proposals now, rather than later.  However, there were a few caveats to this new fiscal responsibility proposal, one of which allowed for emergency funding to be exempt.  What we have witnessed in the last four months has been a truly genius way of skirting around Pay-Go by the majority.  They have deemed a grotesque amount of domestic spending as ‘emergency funding’ when it is, in fact, not. 

They have done this most recently with unemployment benefits. It’s hard to argue that funding that we knew would expire is an emergency, but they have tried to do so anyway.  The real sticking point here is that if we are to deem every spending measure that comes to the floor of this body as ‘emergency funding’ then we are only speeding up our path to fiscal ruin and ensuring that our record-breaking national debt continues to be just that, record-breaking.

$13 trillion dollars. Our national debt reached a new milestone this year, but it’s not one that I think many were celebrating.  Our national debt broke into a new stratosphere when it crossed the threshold of $13 trillion. That is a truly astounding number.  But this gets even worse, over the next ten years, under President Obama’s budget, the debt that will be added will be three times the amount rung up over the first 232 years of our country’s history.

Just like an average American family, when they delay payment on a purchase and charge it to their credit card, they are borrowing money from the bank with interest added onto the amount that they need to pay back.  The United States, when borrowing money and charging on its credit card, is in the same situation.  However, our country isn’t borrowing money from a bank; we are borrowing it from China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia.  Each time the majority deems a spending bill as ‘emergency funding’ and we delay paying for the cost of the legislation, we are adding this onto our national credit card bill with interest paid to China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia.  At any point these countries could decide to up our interest rates to such a level that when we attempt to start paying down our debt, we are only able to afford to pay off the interest owed, not the actual debt.  Further, should our economic situation continue to decline, these countries could revoke our borrowing privileges all together, which would be catastrophic for our economy.

When President Obama first took office, a child born in the United States was born with $85,000 of debt on its back.  Imagine that, $85,000 owed from a newborn the second that it took its first breath.  Now, nearing the end of June, a child born in this country owes $114,000 in debt.  What this means is that if every American, newborn babies included, were to write a check for $114,000 we could start paying off our national debt, with interest.  Going even father into the future, should President Obama receive a second term and our spending levels stay at the high level that they are now, a child born into the United States will owe $196,000. 

I’ve spoken a lot over this past year about the future of our country and what this debt burden will mean.  A newborn child owing $196,000 will mean that this child is unable to pay for college, to buy a house, to start a small business, to raise a family, and to retire.  This isn’t an abstract number; we actually owe these countries the money that we have borrowed from them, with interest.  We have to pay it back- whether these countries demand payment 5 years from now or 100 years from now, we still have to pay it back.

Let me remind you of the final number that I mentioned earlier: 60% of GDP.  This number represents a critical milestone on the path to fiscal ruin. Most of us remember the images that we saw on the nightly news of the riots breaking out across the country in Greece when it was revealed that the government was beyond bankrupt and was no longer able to guarantee services throughout the country.  Historically, our federal debt has been 35% of GDP.  Since Democrats have taken control of Congress, this debt has sky-rocketed.  The tipping point is what Greece found when they had so much debt on their books that people realized they were going to be unable to pay it back.  The country collapsed.  The tipping point where the world community realized that they should be charging a lot more to lend Greece money was 60% of GDP.  The United States passed 60% this year.

60 % was the tipping point for Greece, how far behind them are we really? The United States passed 60% of GDP this year with the help of the healthcare bill, the $200 billion that should have been offset under Pay-Go, the stimulus bill, and last year’s appropriation bills which had large increases in each one.  The country of Greece is foreshadowing the fate of the United States if we don’t start to take responsibility for the fiscal mess that we have created.  We have lived this year through instant gratification policies and not only is the future of our country in jeopardy, so are the next 10 years, the next 5 years, and this year.

$30 billion represents the amount of money that the Democrats want to add to our national debt to extend unemployment benefits when the option to pay for them is only a vote away. $200 billion represents the amount of money that has been deemed as ‘emergency funding’ by the majority party to circumvent their own fiscal policy of ‘pay as you go’.  $13 trillion represents the record-breaking national debt that we reached just this year.  $114,000 is the amount of money a newborn born in this country owes the federal government the second that it takes its first breath.  60% of GDP is the tipping point of economic collapse that puts the United States one step closer to Greece.  To many in this body, these are just numbers.  I think that we all have to face the reality that these numbers represent the markers on our path to fiscal ruin.   

We are heading dangerously close to a fiscal catastrophe and our country stands at a crossroads. We have to draw a line in the sand and stop borrowing money for legislation when the option to pay for it stands only a vote away.  Extending unemployment benefits isn’t a partisan issue and neither is our country’s impending fiscal crisis.  The Senate needs to extend these benefits by paying for them now, and then we can take the first step in the right direction toward fiscal responsibility and economic recovery.
