Senator John Ensign announced that the Gold Star Parents bill, which he sponsored, was signed into law by President Obama. This bill expands state run VA nursing home care for parents of those who died while serving in the armed forces.
 
“Our servicemen and –women put their lives on the line to protect the freedom of all American citizens and now, through this legislation, we can continue to honor that sacrifice by protecting the parents of fallen servicemembers,” said Ensign. "This new law ensures that the service of these men and women will not be forgotten and that their legacy will live on through their Gold Star Parents and through the continued support of groups such as The American Legion.”
 
Peter Gaytan, executive director of The American Legion in Washington, D.C., commented on Senator Ensign’s work and dedication to the Gold Star Parents bill.
 
“This is a milestone that The American Legion has been hoping to achieve for many years,” said Gaytan. “Gold Star parents have already suffered the pain of losing at least one son or daughter serving in the military. They deserve more than our gratitude for such a terrible loss. Providing them with these benefits will make a substantial contribution to their quality of life, and we salute Sen. Ensign for his leadership in getting this bill passed.”
