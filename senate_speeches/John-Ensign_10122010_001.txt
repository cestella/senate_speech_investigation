Senator John Ensign today announced the bipartisan legislation that he was a lead author on, The Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act of 2010 (S. 3751), unanimously passed the Senate  and was signed into law by President Obama. This bill will have a profound impact on the thousands of people battling life-threatening illnesses by reauthorizing federal aid for bone marrow and cord blood treatments.
 
“This law proves that we can set aside party differences and work together on legislation that will profoundly impact the lives of many,” said Ensign. “This law reauthorizes federal funding for the development of new methods that utilize adult stem cells for the treatment of diseases. Cord blood stem cells and bone marrow transplants have already proven to be successful treatments, and this new law will allow for more bone marrow and cord blood donations and collections and ultimately help save thousands of lives.”
 
Legislation requirements:
 
Have qualified cord blood banks develop an annual plan and demonstrate ongoing progress toward achieving self-sufficiency

Increase cord blood collection through novel approaches such as remote collection and help establish or contract with new collection sites  
 

Collect and maintain at least 150,000 high-quality and diverse cord blood units for transplantation through the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program
