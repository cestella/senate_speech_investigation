Senator John Ensign released the following statement in reaction to an expected report from the Treasury today that confirms last week’s Congressional Budget Office report that this year’s annual deficit is $1.3 trillion: 
 
"The spending problem of the majority party in Washington, D.C., has ushered the United States into the record books yet again.  Americans are outraged that Democrats in Washington left town with a record-breaking $1.3 trillion annual deficit, a $13.5 trillion total debt and without extending the tax breaks for small business owners across Nevada that are needed to create jobs and get this economy back on track. Nevadans are tired of the irresponsible spending practices back in Washington, and they are tired of the empty rhetoric that has continued to stall economic recovery in our state."
