Senator John Ensign was honored as a recipient of the National Association of Manufacturers’ (NAM) Manufacturing Legislative Excellence award for his consistent voting record to promote economic expansion. Senator Ensign received an exceptional score of 92% from NAM, demonstrating his commitment to protecting small businesses in Nevada and across the country.
 
“Right now, there are many hardworking Nevadans who are willing to work, yet struggling to find jobs,” said Ensign. “Our state has suffered tremendous economic blows and, as a result, we have the highest unemployment rate in the country. It’s time for Congress to turn its focus away from trying to create more government jobs and instead work to create an environment that will allow small business to once again be the engine of our economy in job creation. I will continue to fight to get Nevadans back to work and to get our economy back on track."
 
NAM represents both large and small manufacturers in every state and across all sectors.  To score the members of the 111th Congress, NAM complied and evaluated each member’s voting record on manufacturing issues.
