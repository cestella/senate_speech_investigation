Senator John Ensign today announced legislation that will make it illegal to publish the name of a human intelligence (HUMINT) informant  to the United States military and intelligence community to protect both the life of the person and our national security interests in light of the threat that WikiLeaks poses to both. Senator Ensign's bill does not ban anyone from publishing leaks directly but will make it illegal for a group such as WikiLeaks to publish the name of those helping in our efforts against terrorism.
 
"There is a distinct difference between a whistleblower and a person who knowingly endangers the lives of many because of the information that they publish," said Ensign. "With this newest document dump, WikiLeaks has knowingly endangered the lives of thousands and further threatened our military efforts. My legislation will extend the legal protections for government informants, such as the Iraqis named in this latest document dump, and will prevent an organization such as WikiLeaks from hiding like a coward behind a computer mainframe while putting lives in jeopardy."
 
By amending Title 18 Section 798, a section of law more commonly known as the Espionage Act, the bill would extend legal protections that already exist for communications intelligence and cryptography to HUMINT.
