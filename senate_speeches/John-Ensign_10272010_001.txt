Senator John Ensign today announced that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has approved the decision to extend and expand silver and gold mining operations at the Coeur/Rochester mine in Pershing County. Senator Ensign has been actively engaged in this issue for months, working directly with BLM leaders, meeting with Pershing County officials, visiting with miners and employees and holding a town hall meeting with Pershing County residents in order to express his commitment to the mine.

“The Coeur/Rochester mine is vital to the economic stability of Pershing County,” said Ensign.  "People across Nevada are grappling with record-high unemployment rates, but in counties such as Pershing where one industry is the main source of employment, high unemployment is crippling. I know how important this mine is to the many Nevadans that rely on its operation to feed their families, pay their bills and put a roof over their heads. For this reason, I urged BLM leaders and other representatives to move quickly on the Environmental Assessment (EA) to ensure that the Coeur/Rochester mine remained active in Nevada and could start hiring immediately.  Right now, it's crucial that we protect and fight for private sector jobs in our state.”

The BLM conducted an EA of the mining site and concluded that conditions were suitable to move forward with the expansion of the Coeur/Rochester mine.
