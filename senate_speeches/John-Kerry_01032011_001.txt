BOSTON – Senators John Kerry and Scott Brown today announced that fire departments across Massachusetts have received $1,972,528 for critically needed equipment and safety gear for first responders.

The funding, awarded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)’s Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) and the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Grants, will increase the number of firefighters available to fire departments and communities and provide new equipment, safety gear, emergency vehicles, and training.

“Our firefighters put their lives on the line for us day in and day out, and we have a responsibility to do whatever it takes to keep them safe on the job,” said Sen. Kerry.  “This investment will allow fire chiefs to take all possible measures to ensure the safety of our communities and firefighters each time the alarm bell goes off.  I’m proud to have worked with the Delegation to help make this possible.”

“Our firefighters put themselves in harm’s way to protect our safety, and we owe it to them to ensure they have the equipment and manpower they need,” said Sen. Brown.  “This funding is an important step toward ensuring they have the proper tools and resources, and I’m pleased our state is receiving these grants.”
