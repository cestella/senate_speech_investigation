BOSTON – Senator John Kerry and Congressman Richard E. Neal announced today that the Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA) in Springfield will receive $750,000 to purchase new, wheelchair accessible buses.

The funding, granted by the U.S. Department of Transportation, will go towards two 40-foot “low floor” buses that have no steps at the entrance and provide improved safety and access for the elderly and those in wheelchairs. 

“This means safer and more accessible public transportation in the Springfield area,” said Sen. Kerry.

“Many people in western Massachusetts depend upon public transportation each day to go to work, visit family or attend to their personal business,” said Rep Neal.  “This grant will allow the PVTA to purchase two new buses that will service communities throughout the Pioneer Valley. It is another significant investment in our local public transportation system.”
