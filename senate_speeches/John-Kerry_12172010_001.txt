BOSTON – Tonight, Senators John Kerry and Scott Brown called on Congress to continue funding the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) through September 30, 2011.

 In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Bay State Senators urged inclusion of the home heating oil program in any short-term Continuing Resolution the Senate takes up in the coming days to help “low-income families cope during this tough economic climate.”  The loss of funding, the Senators wrote, “would be devastating for our states during a brutal cold period.”

 The full text of the letter is below:

 The Honorable Harry Reid                                                     The Honorable Mitch McConnell

Majority Leader                                                                      Republican Leader

United States Senate                                                              United States Senate

Washington, DC 20510                                                          Washington, DC 20510

 Dear Leaders:

We write to request that you extend funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) through September 30th, 2011, in any short-term Continuing Resolution (CR).   

 As you know, the LIHEAP program provides critical heating and cooling assistance for low income households.  Although a short-term CR would fund LIHEAP at last year’s level of $5.1 billion, given the uncertainty of final Fiscal Year 2011 (FY11) funding, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may again provide State funding allocations based on significantly lower levels during the coldest months of the year.  This would be consistent with the October 28th release of LIHEAP funding, which was based upon $2.71 billion in total funding, roughly a cut of 40 percent from last year’s levels.  

This result would be devastating for our states during a brutal cold period. Compounding the situation is the increased cost of home heating oil, which is roughly 12 percent higher than last year.   Again, given the unique structure of the program, unless we finalize funding for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2011 now, the millions of Americans who need help paying their energy bills this winter could see no additional assistance.  As such, we would request that you extend LIHEAP’s funding through September 30th, 2011, at last year’s funding levels, in any short-term CR.  This would provide stability to the program and allow HHS to allocate LIHEAP funds in a timely manner to provide vital heating assistance this winter.   

 Again, we want to thank you for your commitment to helping low-income families cope during this tough economic climate, and look forward to working together in a fiscally responsible manner to address this serious issue.
