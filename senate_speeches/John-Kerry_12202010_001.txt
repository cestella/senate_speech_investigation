WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.), today released the following statement after FCC Commissioner Michael Copps announced his support for proposed FCC rules to safeguard network neutrality. The three Democratic members of the five-member commission have now come out in support of new network neutrality rules, paving the way for their approval.  

“The FCC’s Democratic Commissioners should be applauded for reaching a consensus on rules that will protect network neutrality on the Internet.  As Commissioner Copps, a lifelong champion of open communications and democratic discourse, said in his statement today, vigilant and vigorous implementation of the rule is critical to its success.  And while he and Commissioner Clyburn, as well as many of the champions of network neutrality, including myself, would have supported a stricter order, I commend them for rising to the moment and making possible very meaningful progress to preserve the freedom to communicate and compete over the Internet.  I also join them in commending Chairman Genachowski for his inclusive, thoughtful, and creative work in bringing parties together, airing all points of view, and finding a principled center.”
