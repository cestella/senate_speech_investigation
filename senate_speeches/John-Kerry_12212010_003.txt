BOSTON – Senator John Kerry today released a statement after the U.S. Census Bureau announced that Massachusetts will lose one of its 10 Congressional districts:

“The news from the Census Bureau underscores the importance of the seniority, clout, and effectiveness of our congressional delegation. Over the years we’ve done so well because of our qualitative advantage more than our sheer numbers. Our seniority on key committees and our deep relationships with the White House and the Administration will only be more important with Massachusetts poised to lose a congressional seat, and it’s up to our delegation to double down and fight even harder to bring home investments and resources for the people we serve.”
