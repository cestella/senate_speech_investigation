WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Senate today passed legislation, the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Reauthorization Act, that included provisions authored by Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.), former Chairman of the Small Business Committee, to reauthorize two critical programs supporting innovative research for small businesses.

In 2009 small businesses in Massachusetts received over $270 million through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs. As a result of today’s reauthorization, these programs can continue for an additional eight years.

 “This bill will help sustain small business growth in Massachusetts and create jobs across our state. It helps keep Massachusetts on the cutting edge of innovation by ensuring that small businesses have a fair shot at federal contracts,” Sen. Kerry said.

 The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs, administered through the Small Business Administration (SBA), ensure that America’s small businesses are included in national research and development efforts.

 S. 4053, the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act that unanimously passed the Senate today, includes the following Kerry provisions to:

 

Reauthorize the SBIR and STTR programs;
 

Increase the award guidelines for SBIR and STTR awards from $100,000 to $150,000 for Phase I and from $750,000 to $1 million for Phase II;
 

Increase the STTR program allocation; and
 

Reauthorize the Federal and State Technology Partnership program, or FAST program and the Rural Outreach Program.
