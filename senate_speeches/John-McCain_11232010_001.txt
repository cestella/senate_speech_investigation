Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) today made the following statement regarding the North Korean attack on South Korea:
 
"I was deeply saddened and outraged to learn that two South Korean Marines were killed in this latest act of North Korean aggression. My thoughts and prayers today are with the families of the fallen, and I join the Korean people in mourning this tragic loss of life. North Korea's continued belligerence toward the Republic of Korea is unacceptable, and the United States stands ready to assist our Korean ally in defending itself.

“This latest attack is anything but an isolated incident. Together with recent reports that North Korea has assembled a new uranium enrichment facility and its sinking earlier this year of the South Korean corvette, Cheonan, which killed 46 South Korean sailors, today's attack is part of a long and troubling pattern of North Korean aggression, provocation, and total disregard for its own international agreements. Two decades worth of attempts to appease this North Korean regime have failed, and further attempts to do so will meet with the same result. The Chinese government has perhaps the most influence on North Korea, and for the sake of regional security and stability, I urge China to play a more direct and responsible role in changing North Korea's reckless behavior.”
