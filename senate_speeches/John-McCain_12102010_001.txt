WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator John McCain made the following statement regarding the recent announcement by the Marine Corps to station the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter at the Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) in Yuma, Arizona:
“I applaud the Marine Corps’ decision to station the next generation F-35B Joint Strike Fighter at MCAS in Yuma,” said Senator John McCain.  “This basing decision allows the men and women flying the F-35 the opportunity to take advantage of the unparalleled flying and training opportunities at the nearby Barry M. Goldwater Range.  This is a win-win, and reflects the long-standing support for the Marine Corps by the people of Yuma and the commitment of the Marine Corps to the people and communities in Arizona.”

The Department of the Navy approved a Record of Decision to base five operational F-35B Joint Strike Fighter squadrons and one operational test and evaluation squadron consisting of up to 88 total aircraft at MCAS in Yuma, Arizona.

The F-35B is the newest 5th Generation aircraft which combines both the ability to fight in air-to-air combat against other aircraft and the ability to strike targets on land and at sea.  Its stealth radar evading capabilities and ability to detect and defeat radar and surface-to-air missile systems make the F-35 the most capable aircraft of its kind in the world.

The Marine Corps version of the new aircraft, the F-35B, will have unique short takeoff and vertical landing capability to allow operations from large amphibious ships at sea as well as from improvised runways on land, close to the Marines fighting on the front lines.
