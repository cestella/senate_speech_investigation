WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator John McCain made the following statement regarding Brian A. Terry, a Border Patrol Agent who was killed in the line of duty last night in Rio Rico, Arizona:
“My thoughts and prayers are with the friends and family of Agent Brian Terry after yesterday’s tragic shooting near Rio Rico, Arizona.  This event is yet another reminder of the dangers the men and women of the Border Patrol face every day as they put their lives on the line to protect the American people.  The increased violence in the border region demands that Congress provide the necessary resources and personnel to ensure the safety of all Americans, especially border patrol agents stationed on the border, and fulfill the Federal government’s responsibility to secure our border.”
