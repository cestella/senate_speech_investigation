Washington, D.C.—Senator Jay Rockefeller—author of the EPA-suspension legislation that would make Congress, not the EPA, the decision-maker on energy policy—issued the following statement on the new EPA permitting guidance released today:
 
“If we want to encourage companies to invest in new technologies and create jobs, then we need a system that gives major employers the framework to do so and to succeed. I am concerned that the EPA has not provided these employers enough time to process and understand rules that they will be required to comply with in just two months time.  In fact, it is still unclear what exactly will be required to receive a greenhouse gas air permit next year, as each state will be making case-by-case decisions.  Such an unstable regulatory environment prevents companies from making long range investment decisions that will put West Virginians back to work.  That is why the Senate needs to pass my legislation to suspend EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gases.”
