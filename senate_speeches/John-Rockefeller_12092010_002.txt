“Today’s announcement from HHS is a small but important step forward for consumers. Consumers need to get the straight story about ‘mini-med’ policies that do not protect them if they get seriously sick or injured. We pledged to bring more transparency to the health care process. I’ve heard firsthand about the devastating impact that inadequate coverage can have on individuals and families. These ‘mini-med’ policies have gaping holes in coverage and do not help with serious health problems. I am encouraged by HHS taking this step to begin to improve consumer protections as we transition to a fully reformed insurance market in 2014.”
