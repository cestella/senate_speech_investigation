Today’s news that Macy’s Inc. will have a new Fulfillment Center in the Eastern Panhandle is a win for West Virginia and a major boost during a tough economic time. This new Fulfillment Center will be a job-generator, employing approximately 1,200 associates in addition to approximately 700 seasonal workers. Even as our economy shows signs of recovery, West Virginia still needs more job opportunities like this one, and Macy’s is a signature U.S. company that West Virginia will be proud to call its own. 

“I know Macy’s had options about where to place this center, and the Eastern Panhandle was selected out of more than 100 locations. I am confident this was the right decision as Macy’s will come to learn that the work ethic of West Virginians is second to none.”
