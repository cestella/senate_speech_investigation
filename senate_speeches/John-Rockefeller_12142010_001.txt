“Ambassador Richard Holbrooke dedicated his life to the service of our nation and worked tirelessly to advance peace and progress overseas.  Ambassador Holbrooke was a great thinker; he was the rare combination of an intellectual with big and complex ideas, along with the leadership skills and forceful personality to implement them.
 
“I’ve had the privilege of knowing and working with Ambassador Holbrooke for years, and I have tremendous respect for his accomplishments.  From Vietnam to the Balkans, from Germany to Afghanistan and Pakistan, he has made lasting contributions to U.S. security and international stability.  The passing of Ambassador Holbrooke is a major loss for our efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and for our country and our allies, but he leaves an enduring legacy of peace and progress.  My thoughts and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this difficult time.”
