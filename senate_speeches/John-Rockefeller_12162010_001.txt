Washington, D.C.—Senator Jay Rockefeller has informed Senate Leadership that he will insist on a vote on his EPA-suspension legislation this year. If left with no other option, Senator Rockefeller will seek to suspend the rules on the Omnibus Appropriations bill to bring up his legislation. 

“The time has come for us to make a decision on the energy future of our country,” said Senator Rockefeller. “I have spent this year fighting to make sure that Congress, not the EPA, determines how best to reduce greenhouse gases in a way that protects West Virginia’s economy. While there are still ongoing discussions about how Congress should proceed, I want to make it clear that I intend to get a vote this year on my EPA-suspension legislation. I know there is bipartisan support for this legislation, and if necessary, I will seek to suspend the rules and bring this up for a vote. This is too important for us to delay any further.”

Background:

Senator Rockefeller’s legislation will allow two years for Congress to consider energy legislation in lieu of EPA greenhouse gas regulations which would otherwise take effect on January 2, 2011.   The legislation directs that for two years after enactment the EPA may take no action to make stationary sources of carbon dioxide or methane emission, such as power plants, refineries, and manufacturing facilities, subject to permitting requirements or New Source Performance Standards under the Clean Air Act.  However, the legislation allows continued implementation of widely-supported motor vehicle emission standards.
