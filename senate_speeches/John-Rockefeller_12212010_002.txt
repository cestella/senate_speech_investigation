Washington, D.C.—Senator John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV issued the following statement regarding the failure of the 2011 Omnibus Appropriations bill:

“I am extremely disappointed Senate Republicans have blocked consideration of the omnibus appropriations bill. The legislation had essential funding for West Virginians, including desperately needed support for our armed forces overseas and for critical priorities here at home.
 
“Last week, Republicans walked away from people and communities throughout West Virginia who deserve a hand-up in our struggling economy- to offer better educational opportunities for our children, to help seniors heat their homes for the winter, to build roads, to provide clean water for households, and to support our military and veterans.  The omnibus would have invested in what West Virginia needs and has asked for- projects that make a positive difference for our economy and future.  A Continuing Resolution is not an adequate substitute for that legislation.  Senate Republicans have let down the people of West Virginia and our country.”
 
Background:
 
Last week, it was announced that the Senate no longer had the necessary 60 votes to begin consideration of the FY 2011 Omnibus Appropriations, as a result of nine Republican Senators reversing their previous intentions to support the measure.   Senate leaders are now working out the terms of another short-term Continuing Resolution to keep the government operating through early March 2011. Among many other core programs, the omnibus would have included funding for our health care workforce and public education system, supported our nation’s homeless veterans, and provided vital funding to support the health and safety of our hardworking miners, as well as nearly $200 million to meet specific West Virginia priorities that Senator Rockefeller worked to secure after the passing of Senator Byrd.  
 
Senator Rockefeller very strongly supported the advancement of the Omnibus Appropriations bill.  Because the funding he sought for West Virginia cannot be carried out through a Continuing Resolution,  he is very concerned about the impact that this will have on high priority West Virginia initiatives.  He does not support postponing to the next Congress a final FY 2011 measure, given that Senate and House Republicans are already pushing for a three-year moratorium on earmarks.  Senator Rockefeller will continue to fight for these West Virginia projects and priorities and he is hopeful that Republicans will work with Democrats to explore every option for protecting West Virginia requests. 
    
A few specific examples of how the omnibus would have helped West Virginia include:
 
·         Veterans. $46.55 million for the construction of a new 90,000 square-foot, 90-bed nursing home facility and adult day care center at the Beckley VAMC.  The bill also includes $20 million for the establishment of new Veterans Affairs outpatients clinics, $10 million which is specifically dedicated to establishing clinics in rural areas. 
 
·         Defense. $11 million to construct a new joint emergency operations center for the State of West Virginia and the West Virginia National Guard within the secure border of the Yeager Airbase in Charleston, as well as $13 million for the West Virginia National Guard to implement mandatory force protection and security enhancements at the Yeager Airbase.   Additionally, the Omnibus included $6.468 million for the West Virginia National Guard to continue operations of the Joint Interagency Training and Education Center (JITEC), based at Camp Dawson.  Funds were also included to aid in the completion of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Advanced Training Center in Harpers Ferry.
 
·         Mine Safety. $12 million for the Department of Labor and $4.3 million for the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission to reduce the backlog of contested mine safety violations.  The bill also contains a total of $2 million for mine rescue team training and mine worker training.
           
·         Basic Infrastructure. Funding to allow the State of West Virginia to continue making progress on the construction of Corridor H, the Raleigh Street Extension project, West Virginia Route 10, and to invest in improvements at West Virginia’s airports. 
It includes $4.78 million to complete the Island Creek Flood Control Project in Logan.  The bill also included $1.011 to repair the hydraulically operated gates that control the outflow of the Jennings Randolph Lake to prevent gate failure. It includes $600,000 for the Town of Moorefield to aid in the construction of a Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant in Moorefield, which would eliminate five small treatment plants, meet stringent effluent discharge requirements to better protect the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay, and protect 3,000 existing poultry processing jobs and 9,000 to 18,000 poultry-related jobs. 
 
·         Health.  $2.3 million for the Marshall University Institute of Interdisciplinary Research, which will explore genetic research into the possible causes and cures of diseases such as diabetes and obesity related problems, as well as $2.3 million for West Virginia University to complete the build out of space and equipment for the WVU Multiple Sclerosis Center, which will provide research capabilities for cures and treatments for multiple sclerosis, as well as provide support services for families. 
 
·         Workforce Development.  $3 million for West Virginia Northern Community College for the construction of the Weirton Center for Economic and Workforce Advancement. 
 
Agriculture.  The bill includessufficient funding for the continued operations of the Appalachian Farming Systems Research Center in Beaver (the Administration proposed closing this facility in its FY 2011 budget.  Absent funding in the Omnibus, this 55-employee facility faces permanent closure.).  The measure also includes $280,000 to continue the West Virginia Integrated Predation Management program.  Without this funding, cattle, sheep, and goat farmers will face significant challenges in protecting their herds from ever growing and aggressive coyote packs and other animal predators.
