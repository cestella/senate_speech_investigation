Washington, D.C.—Senator Jay Rockefeller issued the following statement on the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011, both of which passed today in the U.S. Senate:

“Russia remains one of America’s most important strategic relationships and although we sometimes think of the nuclear arms race as a thing of the past, its consequences live on.  The New START Treaty is an important step toward resetting the relationship for both countries.

“The Defense Authorization bill has the potential to do great things for our troops and for West Virginia. The bill authorizes funding for new readiness centers in West Virginia, a 1.4 percent pay raise for our service members, and better TRICARE coverage for our veterans and military families—including coverage for children up to 26 years old, in line with the Affordable Care Act.  This authorization is a step in the right direction, but the funds still have to be appropriated, which is why I will continue to push for completion of the Defense Appropriations Act. These are men and women who serve our country honorably and we owe them a great deal, I am proud to support them.”
