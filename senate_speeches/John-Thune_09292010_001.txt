September 29th, 2010 - WASHINGTON, DC - Senator John Thune today offered an amendment to the Continuing Resolution (CR) put forward by the Democrat majority currently being considered before the Senate that would have saved the American taxpayers nearly $22 billion annually. Thune's amendment would have reduced federal spending not related to defense, homeland security, or veterans by five percent. Thune's amendment was subject to a 60-vote threshold and failed by a vote of 48-51. 

"With non-defense discretionary spending having increased by 21 percent over the past two years, I find it difficult to understand why Democrats would block this common sense amendment to reduce federal spending by five percent," said Thune. "With the new fiscal year beginning on Friday, the Continuing Resolution put forward by my Democrat colleagues only perpetuates the out of touch federal spending levels we have witnessed in recent years." 

Because the Senate has failed to pass any of the 12 annual appropriations bills, a CR is necessary to continue funding for federal programs.
