December 1st, 2010 - Washington, DC - Senator John Thune today criticized the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) announcement to pursue broadband network neutrality regulations that would limit effective network management and jeopardize new broadband deployment during their upcoming December 21st meeting. 

"Chairman Genachowski has once again proposed a solution in search of a problem," said Thune. "There is no evidence of systemic broadband market failure, and the FCC's proposed Internet regulations will only create more uncertainty for broadband providers, which will deter broadband deployment and cost jobs in a growing sector of our economy. This is yet another step down the path of Internet regulation and President Obama's big government agenda."
