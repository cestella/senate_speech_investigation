December 13th, 2010 - WASHINGTON, DC - Senator John Thune today introduced an amendment to fully pay for the $56.5 billion extension of long-term Unemployment Insurance benefits included in the tax package currently being debated in the Senate. Thune's amendment would be paid for by permanently rescinding $86 billion in unspent, unobligated discretionary government funds. 

"Providing relief for Americans who are struggling to find a job is important, but Washington must pay for this spending," said Thune. "Congress spends too much and failing to pay for this continued 99-week extension of Unemployment Insurance will only contribute to our rapidly growing, dangerous national debt. The American people sent a clear message on election day: They want their government to pay its bills." 

Thune's amendment allows the Office of Management and Budget to determine which government agencies should experience a rescission of unspent or unobligated funding and includes common sense exemptions to protect national security and veterans affairs spending.
