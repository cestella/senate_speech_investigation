December 14th, 2010 - WASHINGTON, DC - Senator John Thune today criticized Senate Democrat leadership's attempt to pass a massive Omnibus spending bill. 

"The attempt by Democrat leadership to rush through a nearly 2,000 page spending bill in the final days of the lame-duck session ignores the clear will expressed by the voters this past election," said Thune. "This bill is loaded up with pork projects and should not get a vote. Congress should listen to the American people and stop this reckless spending." 

Thune has called for a short-term Continuing Resolution (CR) free of earmarks and special funding projects. Currently, the federal government is funded under a CR that expires on Saturday, December 18, 2010.
