December 17th, 2010 - WASHINGTON, DC - Senator John Thune issued the following statement regarding the Senate Majority Leader's decision last night to abandon the Democrats' proposed $1.2 trillion omnibus spending bill: 

"The American people have spoken and they reject Washington spending sprees and this type of closed-door deal making in Congress," said Thune. "I'm pleased that Republicans stood together to stop this $1.2 trillion, 2,000-page spending bill from passing. Instead of continuing the old Washington way of doing business, we must listen to the concerns expressed by voters this past Election Day." 

Thune is an original sponsor of a short-term Continuing Resolution (CR) free of earmarks that will provide funding to keep government operations at 2010 funding levels until February 18, 2011. Currently, the federal government is funded under a CR that expires at midnight on Saturday, December 18, 2010.
