December 21st, 2010 - WASHINGTON, DC - Senator John Thune today criticized the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) decision to enact network neutrality regulations that would limit effective network management and jeopardize new broadband deployment. 

"The FCC's decision to adopt controversial regulation of the Internet is yet another example of the heavy hand of government reaching into an industry that isn't broken and doesn't need to be fixed," said Thune. "This unnecessary and unwarranted Internet regulation will discourage investment and innovation in broadband services, especially in rural areas. Today's decision by the FCC will create uncertainty for consumers and providers, and ultimately cost jobs." 

Thune will continue working with his colleagues in the Senate to stop these regulations, including potential actions under the Congressional Review Act, which gives Congress an expedited mechanism for overturning administrative regulations.
