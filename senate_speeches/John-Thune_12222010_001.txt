December 22nd, 2010 - Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator John Thune (R-S.D.), today issued the following statement regarding the Senate's ratification of the New Strategic Arms Treaty (New START). 

"Today's vote to ratify this flawed arms control treaty is a missed opportunity to strengthen America's national security," said Thune. "New START, as negotiated by the Obama Administration, fails to protect America's right to pursue and implement vital missile defenses or address Russia's massive tactical nuclear weapons arsenal, giving Russia a ten-to-one advantage over the U.S. and our NATO allies."
