 U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today released the following statement on the ninth anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks:

"September 11, 2001, was a tragic day in the history of our country and for that matter all mankind. The deadly attack by radical extremists against innocent human beings marked the beginning of the ultimate war between good and evil. As I pray for the victims and their families, I also pray for the brave men and women of our armed services who pursue those who would promote, harbor or protect radical terrorism. God Bless America."
