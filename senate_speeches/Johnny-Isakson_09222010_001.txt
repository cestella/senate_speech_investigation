U.S. Senators Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., and Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., today praised the Senate's passage of a bipartisan bill to extend the National Flood Insurance Program through September 30, 2011. Isakson and Chambliss were co-sponsors of the legislation, which passed by a voice vote.

"Flood insurance is critically important for the stability of the housing industry and to those Americans seeking this coverage as they purchase a home," Isakson said. "I'm pleased the Senate has agreed to extend the National Flood Insurance Program for an additional year."

"I'm pleased we were successful in passing a one-year extension of the National Flood Insurance Program, which is critical for businesses and homeowners in areas prone to flooding," said Chambliss. "The recent practice of passing short-term extensions provided unnecessary uncertainty for those who rely on the program."
