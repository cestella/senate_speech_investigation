U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today praised passage of a Senate resolution honoring the 30th anniversary of the Small Business Development Center network.

"Small businesses make up the heart of the American economy," Isakson said. "As someone who ran a small business for more than 30 years, including in difficult economic times, I know how helpful it can be to get good advice from professionals. I hope Georgians take advantage of the excellent educational and technical assistance offered by Small Business Development Centers."

Small Business Development Centers provides business advice, one-on-one counseling and in-depth training to individuals and small businesses in central and easily accessible branch locations. The program is a cooperative effort of the private sector, the educational community and federal, state and local governments
