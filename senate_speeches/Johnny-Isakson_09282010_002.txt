U.S. Senators Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., Ranking Republican Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., today issued the following statements regarding the Chinese Commerce Ministry's decision to finalize antidumping duties on imports of U.S. poultry products. The so-called "antidumping" duties on U.S. poultry products were originally put in place last February on a preliminary basis. The move places duties at rates ranging from 43 percent up to 105.4 percent.

"The actions by the Chinese are unfortunate and based on a faulty interpretation of the facts," said Chambliss. "I find it questionable to claim the poultry industry is the recipient of subsidies. It is regrettable the Chinese are targeting this industry to express their frustration with other trade matters. This tit-for-tat action will undoubtedly lead to increase tensions, rather than lessen them."

"As one of the largest poultry producers in the country, Georgia has nearly three-fourths of its 159 counties involved in the poultry business. This decision by the Chinese is unfortunate for Georgia's entire poultry industry, and it could not come at a worse time as Pilgrim's Pride prepares to reopen its plant in Douglas, Georgia. This will only stifle economic growth at a time when Georgia's economy can least afford it," said Isakson. "I urge the Obama Administration to make reversing these duties a high priority."
