WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl made the following statement today regarding the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START):

“When Majority Leader Harry Reid asked me if I thought the treaty could be considered in the lame duck session, I replied I did not think so given the combination of other work Congress must do and the complex and unresolved issues related to START and modernization. I appreciate the recent effort by the Administration to address some of the issues that we have raised and I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Kerry, DOD, and DOE officials.”
