WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl made the following statement today regarding the proposed earmark moratorium:

“I voted for the earmark moratorium when it was offered on the Senate floor on March 16, but it won only 29 votes at the time. I nevertheless refrained from requesting earmarks, and I do not intend to request any in the coming year. I support the moratorium.”
