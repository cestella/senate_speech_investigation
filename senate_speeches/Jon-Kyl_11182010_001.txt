WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl made the following statement regarding the acquittal of Ahmed Ghailani on 284 criminal charges dealing with his involvement in the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa:

“This decision demonstrates the risk of trying terrorists in civilian courts. Despite Attorney General Eric Holder’s assurance that ‘failure is not an option’ in the prosecution of terrorists, this trial came dangerously close to failure. I hope that the Administration heard this wake-up call and will return to the policy of trying these kinds of terrorists in military commissions.”
