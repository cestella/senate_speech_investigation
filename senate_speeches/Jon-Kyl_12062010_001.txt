WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl made the following statement today regarding the announced agreement on an extension of existing tax rates:

“Tonight’s announcement marks an important first step in giving all American families and businesses the certainty that their taxes will not increase on January 1. While I wanted the rates to be made permanent, the current political makeup of this lame-duck Congress would not allow that. What is important now is that we avert a massive tax increase that would further depress an already frail economy.”
