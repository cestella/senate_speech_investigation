WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl today made the following statement regarding Border Patrol Agent Brian A. Terry, who was killed Tuesday in the line of duty near Rio Rico, Arizona:

“I am deeply saddened that Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was shot and killed last night. I extend my deepest condolences to his family, friends and colleagues, and I honor his service and sacrifice in defense of our nation. Our nation is fortunate to have men and women in law enforcement who are willing to protect us at great danger to themselves.

“This act of violence is yet another upsetting reminder of the dangers along the southern border. The federal government must do more to secure the border and prevent future tragedies.”
