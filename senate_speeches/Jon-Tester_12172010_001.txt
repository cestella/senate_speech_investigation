(Washington, D.C.) - Montana’s U.S. Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester announced the Lewistown Fire department will receive some much needed help to make their communities safer.

The money comes from the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) Program.  The AFG Program regularly awards grants to fire departments and emergency medical service organizations across the country to help those agencies purchase equipment, vehicles, protective gear and training programs.

The Lewistown Fire department will receive $36,428.00 to help with ongoing operations and safety.

“Montana’s firefighters are willing to put their lives on the line to protect their communities and we owe them the best equipment possible to get the job done,” Baucus said. “This is great news for folks in Lewistown. I’m pleased to know firefighters will have the extra resources to protect homes and businesses and get home safely to their families.”

“This grant is not just an investment in the Lewistown Fire Department but in the entire community,” Tester said.  “First responders play a critical role because they look out for the best interest of our rural communities every day. They deserve the best equipment, which is why I’m proud to have supported the funding to make this grant a reality.”


The Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Grants and Training has administered the AFG Program with help from the U.S. Fire Administration since 2001.  Congress has authorized funding for the program through 2010.
