(U.S. SENATE) – Senator Jon Tester today released the following statement in advance of his vote against the DREAM Act:
“Illegal immigration is a critical problem facing our country, but amnesty is not the solution.  I do not support legislation that provides a path to citizenship for anyone in this country illegally.”
The Senate is expected to vote on the DREAM Act Saturday.  Tester voted against the measure in 2007.
