(U.S. SENATE) – U.S. Senator Jon Tester tonight released the following statement following Carroll College’s victory over Sioux Falls to claim the NAIA Football Championship:
“Carroll’s Fighting Saints are no strangers to making football history, and tonight’s game reminds us that Montana is home to some of the toughest and most talented folks in the game.  Sharla and I join Montanans everywhere in celebrating tonight’s win, and we send our congratulations to Coach Mike Van Diest and all the young men who carried the Saints through their undefeated season to become national champions.  The Saints won thanks to hard work, strong leadership and old-fashioned Montana grit.  We’re already looking forward to next year.”
