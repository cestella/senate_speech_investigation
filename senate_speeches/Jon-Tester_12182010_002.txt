(U.S. SENATE) – Senator Jon Tester today released the following statement following his vote to repeal Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell:
“Our nation’s military commanders say the repeal of this policy won’t affect the readiness or effectiveness of our armed forces. Based on that assessment, and my belief that no American should have to lie about who they are to serve our military, I support repealing Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”
