(U.S. SENATE) – Senator Jon Tester today congratulated Carroll College’s Fighting Saints on the floor of the United States Senate.  The Helena, Mont., football team beat the Sioux Falls Cougars Saturday to win the NAIA championship.

Tester’s floor speech follows:
Mr. President, I rise today in honor to the Carroll College Fighting Saints football team.  This is tough-as-nails group from Helena, Montana, that won the NAIA national championship yesterday.

It was one of those Saturday night games that fans live for.  And before I say more about the Saints, I want extend my congratulations to the University of Sioux Falls Cougars.  Senator Thune is in the chamber.  He knows what a quality program this is.  They put up a heck of a fight against the Saints.  They had an incredible season, finishing up with an incredible game

But with last night’s win, Carroll held a perfect season.  They were undefeated every step of the way.  And every step of the way, Montanans watched with pride as they showed us what it takes to work as a team.  And to win.

Carroll College’s Fighting Saints are no stranger to making football history.  This isn’t the first year they’ve returned to Montana with a national championship trophy.

What does it take?

It takes hard work, strong leadership like that under Coach Mike Van Diest, and old-fashioned Montana grit.

Most importantly, it takes teamwork.  And trust. Place kicker Tom Yaremko missed two field goals. But Coach Van Diest trusted Yaremko to make it happen again, and he made the winning field goal.

Mr. President, I’m want to take a moment to honor the Fighting Saints this afternoon.  I ask my colleagues in joining me in congratulating the team, to the coaches and to a whole lot of dedicated fans.

Their hard work and their victory is a warm reminder that hard work does pay off.

We’re already looking forward to next year.

With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.
