WASHINGTON—Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman, ID-Conn., announced Monday that the Milford, Crystal Lake and West Shore fire departments have been awarded a total of $410,615 in federal grants. The Milford Fire-Rescue Department is receiving $231,780; the Crystal Lake Fire Department, in Ellington, will receive $138,415 and the West Shore Fire Department in West Haven $40,420. All were awarded under the Department of Homeland Security’s Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) program, which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The grants can be used to support the operations and safety of the departments, including funding equipment and training needs.

“We rely on our first responders, not just in times of crisis, but to protect us on a daily basis,” said Lieberman. “These grants will help ensure that they are well-prepared to do just that and perform their crucial emergency response duties. Connecticut residents can never do enough to thank them for doing such a dangerous job, but this is a fine beginning. Congratulations to the Milford, Crystal Lake and West Shore departments.”

Lieberman has a long history of advocating for fire safety. In 2000 and 2003, respectively, he was a cosponsor of the FIRE and SAFER Acts and last year introduced the Fire Grant Reauthorization Act of 2010. Since the FIRE and SAFER Acts were signed into law FEMA has distributed 618 grants for a total of over $68 million in Connecticut to help fire departments strengthen their response capabilities. Lieberman will be a Co-Chair of the Congressional Fire Caucus in the 112th Congress.
