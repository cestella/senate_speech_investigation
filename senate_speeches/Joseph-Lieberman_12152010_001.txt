WASHINGTON, DC – Senators Joe Lieberman (I-CT) and Susan Collins (R-ME) issued the following statement in reaction to the U.S. House of Representatives’ vote of 250-175 in favor of repealing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”:
 
“The resounding and bipartisan House vote – a total of 250 votes in support of repeal including 15 Republican votes – is an extraordinary step toward our united goal of repealing ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ in the lame duck session.  The Commander-in-Chief, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have all been clear: we must right this wrong and we must do so through Congressional action, rather than through the courts.  We must do it now. 
 
“It is now the Senate’s turn to take the final step toward overturning this discriminatory policy.  We are out of excuses.”
