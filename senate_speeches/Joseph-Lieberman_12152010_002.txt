WASHINGTON – Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Joe Lieberman, ID-Conn., Wednesday issued the following statement about the death of a Border Patrol Agent in Arizona.

“I am deeply saddened to learn of the death of Border Patrol agent Brian A. Terry last night on the southern border in Arizona. His family are in my and Hadassah’s thoughts and prayers. Agent Terry’s murder is a reminder of the great service and willingness to sacrifice that the men and women of Customs and Border Protection embody when they put themselves in harm’s way to protect our country. They serve every day on the front lines of a perilous struggle against the Mexican drug cartels along our southern border, and we must do everything we can to support them in that effort.”
