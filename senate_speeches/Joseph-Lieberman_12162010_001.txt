WASHINGTON, DC – Tonight, Majority Leader Reid filed cloture on the motion to concur with respect to H.R.2965, “The ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ Repeal Act of 2010.”  Senator Joe Lieberman (I-CT) issued the following statement:
 
“I want to thank Senator Reid for his leadership in bringing the ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act of 2010’ to the Senate floor for a vote.  I am confident that we have more than 60 votes to end this law that discriminates against military service members based solely on their sexual orientation.  Repealing ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ will affirm the Senate’s commitment to the civil rights of all Americans and also make our military even stronger.”
