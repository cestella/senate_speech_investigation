WASHINGTON, DC – Senator Joe Lieberman (I-CT) issued the following statement today in response to the White House review of the war in Afghanistan:

“One year ago, President Obama made the right decision to send 30,000 additional combat forces to Afghanistan, as part of a comprehensive counterinsurgency strategy. Because of that decision, the tide in our war effort has slowly begun to turn against the Taliban.

“The hard-won gains we have begun to achieve justify our strategic patience and a continued commitment to Afghanistan. As we look ahead, any withdrawals should be based on the professional military recommendation of General Petraeus and conditions on the ground. We must be very careful not to ‘rush to failure’ in Afghanistan.

“It is also important to recognize that there is still tough fighting ahead. We know that the Taliban will try to reclaim the momentum next spring and summer. But this is a war that we can and must win. Thanks to the surge, and under the leadership of General Petraeus, we have finally begun to do so.”
