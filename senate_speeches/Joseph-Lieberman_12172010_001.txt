WASHINGTON – Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman, ID-Conn., has accepted the nomination to become a co-chair of the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Fire Services Caucus, a group of more than 320 members dedicated to supporting firefighters and fire services legislation. The Senator Friday issued the following statement:

“I am honored and delighted to be nominated to co-chair the Congressional Fire Services Caucus,” Lieberman said. “Firefighters are among those first responders who risk their lives on a daily basis in order to keep the rest of us safe where we work, live, and recreate. In the age of terrorism, their responsibilities have increased, and the dangers they face have multiplied. These brave men and women deserve every ounce of support we in Congress can provide to them so that they can perform their jobs with the best possible equipment and training. I have long advocated for adequate funding for firefighters and I look forward to continuing to advocate for them with my Fire Services Caucus colleagues.”
