WASHINGTON, DC-- Senator Joe Lieberman (I-CT) today applauded the Senate passage of the America COMPETES reauthorization bill.

The American COMEPTES Act became public law in August of 2007. Senator Lieberman was an original cosponsor of that legislation, which sought to enhance America’s competitiveness by boosting our nation’s investment in research and development (R&D) and improving our delivery of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education in an effort to guarantee a workforce that has the skills and talent to innovate and compete in a global economy. The original law included many initiatives contained in legislation authored by Senators Lieberman and Ensign, the National Innovation Act and the National Innovation Education Act. These bills called for increases in research investment, enhanced STEM educational opportunities, and a more effective national innovation infrastructure. Senator Lieberman is an original cosponsor of the Senate reauthorization measure passed today, which continues the federal commitment to research and development, and STEM education.

“It is critical that we continue to invest in those activities that will ensure that our economy remains strong and vital, and that America remains a leader in innovation,” Senator Lieberman said. “The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 does just that by maintaining a national commitment to invest in research and development and by ensuring that tomorrow’s leaders have the skills and training in the critical STEM fields to keep America in the forefront of innovation and maintain our leadership in the global economy.”
