WASHINGTON, DC—Senator Joe Lieberman (I-CT) today issued the following statement in response to the Office of Budget and Management Director Jacob Lew’s letter concerning funding for the continued development of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter for the duration of the continuing resolution passed by the Senate:

“It is unconscionable that while the Air Force and Navy struggle to sustain their essential programs under the constraints of a continuing resolution, the administration could be forced to waste one more dollar on this unnecessary second engine for the Joint Strike Fighter. I will continue to fight to terminate the alternate engine during the term of the CR and when the Senate considers a measure to fund the government for the rest of 2011.

“The representations made in Director Lew’s letter to Senator Brown contradict OMB’s own guidelines about funding programs under a continuing resolution and is inconsistent with the strong opposition of President Obama and Secretary Gates to this second engine. I will ask Director Lew to reconsider based upon those guidelines.”
