WASHINGTON, DC—Senator Joe Lieberman (I-CT) today issued the following statement after President Obama signed the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act into law:

“America became an even greater and stronger country today as President Obama signed the repeal of the discriminatory policy that prohibited gay and lesbian patriots from openly serving in the military. This victory for justice and equality has many authors, but I would particularly like to applaud the leadership of President Obama, Senator Reid, Chairman Levin and Senator Collins, as well as our House counterparts, Speaker Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, and Patrick Murphy. We are deeply indebted to the heroes of our armed services who sacrifice every day so we can enjoy liberty. And American liberty became more complete today when President Obama signed this legislation into law.” ###
