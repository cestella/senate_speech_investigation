Madam President, I want to congratulate the Senator from Vermont.  While I had very severe reservations about his original amendment, he sat down and worked with members on this side of the aisle, with the Chairman of the Committee, members of the Administration and the Fed.  He has come up with an extremely responsible amendment, which gets to the issues of transparency and making sure that to the fullest extent possible, the American people know what's happening with this significant entity which impacts our lives.  Although a lot of Americans don't really know it, the Federal Reserve impacts our lives pretty directly.

I also wish to congratulate Chairman Bernanke and his staff for stepping forward and aggressively pursuing this amendment, which will be very positive for both sides.  I intend to support the Senator from Vermont’s amendment as amended and appreciate his offering it and his responsible effort here.  

I have, however, deep and severe reservations and strongly oppose the Senator from Louisiana’s amendment.  Transparency is not the issue at hand with this amendment.  The issue is whether or not we have a Federal Reserve that can function and pursue its primary purpose, which is maintaining the integrity of the currency of the United States.  

When the Federal Reserve was created back in 1917, there had been a huge debate in this country, since the economic depressions of 1897 and 1907, about how you managed the currency of this country.  The central figure in that debate was William Jennings Bryan, a man of immense proportions in our history.  He was a populist in the extreme, and he believed genuinely that there should be a monetary policy in this country which allowed for free money to be produced.  His Cross of Gold speech was historic.  

His basic view was that publicly elected officials who control the government should have control of the currency.  But, what has been learned over time is that if you turn control of the currency to elected officials, the currency becomes at risk because there is a natural tendency by elected bodies to want to produce money arbitrarily to take care of spending which they deem to be in the public interest.  

And, thanks to the leadership at that time of a number of thoughtful people, including Woodrow Wilson, the decision was made to create a separate entity called the Federal Reserve which would manage the currency of the United States and decide how much money was printed, taking away the printing presses from elected officials.  

This decision has probably been one of the best decisions we have ever made as a nation to ensure a strong fiscal future and a strong economy.  It has allowed us to have a currency that has basically been protected from the winds of the politics of the day, which is absolutely critical.  It's as, if not more, important today as it was when the Federal Reserve was created.  

Today, we are seeing a world where there is a tremendous amount of pressure on the currencies of almost every nation, certainly every developed nation with the exception of a few.  That pressure inevitably leads to popular outrage on occasion, or popular decisions, which request that the currency be devalued in order to produce what some people see as a better lifestyle or to address some concerns that a nation may have.  But, this cannot be done at the whim of elected officials.  It is absolutely critical that a nation’s currency be protected from the day-to-day activities of politics.

And so, the Federal Reserve system was created to accomplish that.  At the essence of that system is the Open Market Committee which decides essentially how much money is going to be in circulation in this country.  We have always felt that this system should have integrity, and should be kept separate from the political process, so that members of Congress won’t have the ability, either directly or indirectly, to influence the decision of the printing of dollars in this nation.  It is a good decision, and we should not abandon that course of action.  

Senator Vitter’s amendment, unfortunately, has as its basic purpose the disassembling of this independence.  It would basically give the Congress the authority, through the GAO, to go in and investigate what happens with the Open Market Committee.  That is clearly going to create consequences which would be inappropriate in the decision-making process of the Federal Reserve.  It would influence their ability to make decisions in the sense that they would be concerned about Congress coming in and investigating.  It would open up activities, which would, if they are not done in some level of confidence, inevitably end up disrupting the markets.  

So it is absolutely critical that the Congress not be allowed to go into the Open Market Committee and audit that part of the Federal Reserve.  It is absolutely critical if we are going to maintain the integrity of the dollar.  Remember, this is about Main Street.  Whether that dollar you take on Main Street to buy clothing, food or a car has the value that you think it has depends entirely on whether or not there is confidence that it is not going to be inflated arbitrarily.  If the political process starts to influence the decision as to how much money is printed in this country and, therefore, affects the inflationary value of the dollar, you will see your dollars devalued as you try to buy things on Main Street.

The effect of that will be devastating on your ability as an American citizen to have confidence in the dollars which you earn, what they're going to buy and what they're going to mean when you save them, which is even more important.  

We cannot have a system which allows Congress to influence the decisions in this critical area.  All the rest of the activity that the Federal Reserve undertakes should be open, should be audited by the Congress and should be available for public inspection on a regular basis, which is essentially what Senator Sanders' amendment does.  There is already a lot of audit activity at the Fed, but what the Sanders amendment does is expand that and make it more widely available to the American people.  

But in this one area which Congress has exempted from review with a logical and appropriate reason -- that we do not want the politics of the day to enter into the decision as to the value of our currency -- in this one area we need to keep the exception and give the Fed that type of protection.  

I strongly oppose the Vitter amendment, and I hope that those who are concerned about having the integrity of our currency maintained will also oppose this amendment.
