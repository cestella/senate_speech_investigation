Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you for your kind comments.  And let me associate myself with Senator Dodd, as I often do, because I agree one hundred percent with his opening statement, and think it was an eloquent recitation of the importance of the filibuster and the rules of the Senate in protecting the Minority.

I was asked to speak today a little bit about a number of issues dealing with this and my perception of them.  I appreciate it and am honored at the chance to talk about it.  But everybody at this dais knows as much as I know about this issue.  And you have certainly been studying it.

So let me just reflect both in historical terms and on a personal experience level why I think this is so critical.  You know, this Committee’s taking up a rules issue, but what you are really taking up is the Constitutional structure of the greatest government ever created in history.  We are the freest, the most prosperous, the most extraordinary nation in the history of the world.  And we are that was because we have a constitutional government that has given us the freedoms and the prosperity that we benefit from.

And I happen to believe that at the center of that constitutional government is the Senate.  Some would argue of course it is the House, because they have the ability to initiate appropriations and tax policy.  But I do not believe it.  I believe that it is the Senate because the Senate is where the rights of the people of this nation are protected.  Especially Minority rights.

It was created for that purpose when Madison and Randolph were thinking of how they were going to structure this government I am sure they had in mind the parliamentary systems that they had seen in Europe.  The fact that they move too quickly and that they trample the rights of the minorities.  And so they set up this structure of checks and balances which is throughout our system, but the ultimate check was and is the Senate of the United States.

So let me read a couple of quotes that I think really capture the essence of the purposes of the Senate.  And we will begin with Webster, who of course was from New Hampshire, although he represented Massachusetts in the Senate.  “This is a Senate of equals, of men of individual honor and personal character, of absolute independence. 
We know no masters, we acknowledge no dictators.  This is a hall for mutual consultation and discussion.”

And then the other member of the triad, Clay.  “The Majority ought never to trample on the feelings or violate the just rights of the Minority.  They ought never to triumph over the fallen, nor make any but temperate and equitable use of their power.”

And then the third member of the triumvirate of great Senators, Calhoun.  “The government of the absolute Majority instead of the government of the people is but the government of the strongest interests.  And when not efficiently checked, it is the most tyrannical and oppressive that can be devised.”

And then another Senator who should be in the triumvirate.  “It is the Senate where the Founding Fathers established a repository of checks and balances.  It is not like the House of Representatives where the Majority Leader or the speaker can snap his fingers and get what he wants.  But the reason we do not always work by the Majority rule is very simple.  On important issues, the Founding Fathers wanted, and they were correct in my judgment, that the slimmest Majority should not always govern when it comes to the vital issues that is what they want.”  That was Senator Schumer.

You can go on and read Byrd, or read Howard Baker, or read Lyndon Johnson, or Harry Reid.  They all came to the same conclusion, the Senate is about protecting the rights of Minority.  And at the essence of protecting the rights of the Minority is the filibuster rule.

Now, I was asked to speak a little bit about the filling of the tree.  The filling of the tree, as was explained very accurately by the Chairman, basically cuts off the Minority rights in a most intemperate and inappropriate way, because it makes it impossible for the Minority to come forward with amendments.

When I arrived here, the whole purpose of the Senate was to bring bills to the floor.  Any Senator who wanted to come to the floor and amend the bill in any way they wanted to pretty much got to do that.  I can remember when we brought appropriations bills out of the Appropriations Committee, I had the good fortune to chair two different Appropriations Committees when their bills went across the floor every year, I would plan when I had the Commerce, State, Justice Committee, to receive amendments on everything, everything under the sun.

There would be gun amendments.  There would be marriage amendments.  There would be Mexico City amendments.  You name it, it was going to come on the bill.  I expected that as the leader on the floor responsible for this piece of legislation.  It was a good discussion, and we always reached a conclusion, although it took a little longer usually depending on who was around.  It took a little longer to get to a conclusion, but we always did it.

When you fill the tree, you cut off the Minority’s ability to make those types of amendments and it really is detrimental to the institution itself because if you do not allow the Minority to amend, in fact if you do not allow every member of the Senate to have an opportunity to amend, then you are basically undermining the whole purpose of the Senate.

Now regrettably, filling the tree has become an unfortunate practice here.  In fact, in this Senate the tree has been filled more than it has been filled under the last six Majority Leaders.  That is not healthy.

And the Chairman talked a little bit about filibustering the motion to proceed.  Why is the motion to proceed a critical motion?  And why should filibuster still be applicable to the motion to proceed?  It is because at that point that the Minority Leader has leverage to negotiate, to the extent that negotiation occurs, how the Bill will be managed when it hits the floor, and what the amendment process will be.  If you shut off that point of pressure, then you once again close down the capacity of the Minority to make its case and get the bill to the floor in the form where amendments can be allowed.

So I believe very strongly, as the Chairman has outlined in his opening statement relative to filling the tree, and as Senator Dodd has outlined relative to the filibuster, that at the essence of the Senate is the ability of the Minority to amend.  That is simply what it is all about.  And if you foreshorten the ability of the Minority to amend, you undermine the purposes of the Senate and you undermine the constitutional form of government we have.

And I thank the Chairman for his time.
