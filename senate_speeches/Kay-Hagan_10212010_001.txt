United States Senator Kay R. Hagan (D-NC) today delivered the morning keynote address at the 2010 Military Construction Summit in Greensboro. The Summit, hosted by the North Carolina Military Center and the North Carolina Military Foundation, is focusing on federal military construction, sustainment, restoration and modernization, green construction opportunities and contracting processes in North Carolina. 

"North Carolina is the most military friendly state in the nation, and while we rank third in our number of military personnel, we are only 26th in the country for number of defense contracts," Hagan said this morning. "I am committed to increasing the number of military contracts. I want North Carolina to become the most sought after state for defense contracting and construction work, known for our tremendous military bases, as well as our defense businesses that produce high-quality work in an efficient manner." 

Hagan told participants, which included approximately 700 contractors, engineers, construction suppliers, government entities and North Carolina military personnel, that the Summit is an important step in securing more military construction contracts for the state. 

"What we need to do is bring together the state's various interested parties to secure lasting partnerships between North Carolina businesses and the military so government contractors know to buy North Carolina," Hagan said. "That is why today's MILCON Summit is such a tremendous opportunity." 

Earlier this year, Hagan hosted the 9th Annual Defense and Economic Development Trade Show in Fayetteville along with Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) and Rep. Larry Kissell (D-NC). The Trade Show linked North Carolina defense businesses with Fort Bragg, Pope Army Airfield and the Fayetteville community.
