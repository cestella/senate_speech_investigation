United States Senator Kay R. Hagan (D-NC) yesterday announced that North Carolina, along with South Carolina and Georgia, will receive two Department of Transportation (DOT) grants for a total of $26.1 million for the Charlotte-Atlanta Corridor Railroad Plan. The $4.1 million and $22 million DOT grants are part of the High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Grant Program.

"Today's announcement means that North Carolina, in partnership with our neighbors to the south, can begin developing a high-speed rail that will make traveling through the Southeast easier and more efficient," Hagan said.

"High-speed rail will help ease congestion on our roads and lessen our dependence on foreign oil. And this project will create jobs for North Carolinians - my number one priority."

The multi-state funding will allow for the improvement of current rail grade, making it suitable for high-speed rail travel. The HSIPR Program grants are intended to help address the nation's transportation challenges by investing in an efficient network of high-speed and intercity passenger rail corridors that connect communities across America.

Hagan voted to fund the 2010 transportation appropriations bill, which included $2.5 billion to improve the country's rail infrastructure.
