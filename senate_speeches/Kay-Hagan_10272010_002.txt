United States Senator Kay R. Hagan (D-NC) today announced that 34 municipal governments, community colleges and school districts in North Carolina will receive $4.5 million to reduce fuel and utility bills and create jobs. The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants (EECBG) are part of a second wave of funding to local agencies in North Carolina through the Recovery Act.

"In this tough economy, these grants will help local governments and schools across the state upgrade aging infrastructure -- benefitting our communities into the future," Hagan said. "I will continue working to secure federal dollars for important projects that reduce energy costs for North Carolinians and create jobs in our state."

The grants will be used to upgrade heat pumps, install energy efficient lighting and solar water heating, and upgrade heating and cooling systems in communities and agencies.

The towns of Taylorsville, Plymouth, Castalia, Craven County schools, Duck, Parmele, and Windsor for example, will receive a total of $406,564 through the funding.

"As a small town manager working with very limited revenues, this grant will prove to be very helpful as a majority of the Town's buildings are over 50 years old," said Taylorsville Town Manager David Odom. "These funds will provide needed repairs and allow the town to reduce its energy consumption, treat waste water more efficiently, and pass these savings on to our citizens."

"I am thankful for the leadership Senator Hagan has provided, she and her fine staff are always open, responsive, and attentive to the needs of Rural North Carolina," he said, "The Infrastructure of Taylorsville, North Carolina continues to improve due to the tireless efforts of Senator Kay Hagan."

The EECBG program is administered by the North Carolina Energy Office, part of the state's Department of Commerce, to encourage energy conservation and economic investment in counties, municipalities, community colleges and public schools.
