 United States Senator Kay R. Hagan (D-NC) yesterday visited Dare County for an information session on the replacement of Bonner Bridge. She met with Dare County Commissioners Warren Judge and Allen Burrus, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, community leaders, and constituents to discuss the project. Hagan also toured Oregon Inlet and the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge.

"Yesterday, I was able to see firsthand the deteriorating state of Bonner Bridge," Hagan said. "It is obvious that the bridge is long overdue for replacement. Each year, two million vehicles travel over the bridge, and the safety of the residents and visitors crossing the bridge is at risk. The bridge is also vital to the Hatteras Island economy, which relies on the tourism industry. I am committed to working with all parties to move plans for a replacement bridge forward as soon as possible to ensure that travel to and from Hatteras Island is safe and the tourism industry in the county can grow."

Hagan toured the Oregon Inlet by boat with Bob Sattin, Chief of Operations for the Army Corps of Engineers, to examine the state of the inlet and underside of the bridge. She toured the Pea Island Wildlife Refuge with Mike Bryant, Project Leader for the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Jane Lyder, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks. 

The state of North Carolina and local residents have been working with the Federal Highway Administration for over 20 years to develop a plan to replace Bonner Bridge. The bridge was built in 1963, with an estimated lifespan of 30 years. Now, 17 years past the projected retirement date, the bridge has yet to be replaced.

Hagan has been working in the Senate to move plans for a replacement bridge forward, and has been in regular contact with Secretary Ken Salazar and the Department of Interior on the issue. At Sen. Hagan's request, Secretary Salazar sent Tom Strickland, Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, to Pea Island Wildlife Refuge in September to meet with interested residents and see firsthand the fragile state of Bonner Bridge.
