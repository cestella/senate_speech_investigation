United States Senator Kay R. Hagan (D-NC) today announced that 12 North Carolina counties that experienced major crop losses due to drought and heat in 2010 received agricultural disaster designations. These counties are now eligible for federal assistance through the Farm Service Agency (FSA).

"Federal aid is now available to North Carolina farmers and producers who suffered significant crop losses this year," Hagan said. "In this already difficult economy, this aid will help ensure that North Carolina farmers affected by excessive drought and heat can continue to farm into the future. I will continue working to support North Carolina's agricultural community in the U.S. Senate."

The 12 North Carolina counties that received disaster designations from the Department of Agriculture are: Gates, Granville, Hertford, Northampton, Vance, Warren, Camden, Rockingham, Stokes, Surry, Caswell and Person.

Farm operators in these counties are eligible to be considered for assistance from the FSA, provided eligibility requirements are met. Farmers have eight months from the date of the disaster declaration to apply for emergency loan assistance. Local FSA offices can provide affected farmers with further information.
