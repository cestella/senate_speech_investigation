United States Senator Kay R. Hagan (D-NC) commented on the 235th birthday of the US Marine Corps.

Sen. Hagan said:

"On this day, we honor the 235th year of the US Marine Corps and the brave men and women who have steadfastly fought to protect our nation. I am proud to say that North Carolina has the largest population of Marines and Marine Corps veterans in the United States. From Camp Lejeune, to Cherry Point, to New River Air Base, Bogue Field and our Marine Corps Reserve Units in Charlotte and Greensboro, we have Marines in every corner of our state. North Carolina Marines have played a huge role in protecting us here at home, and men and women from Camp Lejeune are still fighting to disrupt, dismantle and defeat terrorists abroad. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Senator from North Carolina - the most military-friendly state in the nation - I am committed to supporting our Marines and their families. Happy Birthday Marines!"

Senator Hagan comes from a strong military family. Her father-in-law, General Charles T. Hagan, Jr., was a two-star General in the Marine Corps Reserves who served as a member of the 4th Marine Division at Camp Lejeune in the early 1940s. He also fought in World War II in the Marshall Islands, Saipan, Tinian and Iwo Jima. In addition, Hagan's husband, father and brother are Navy veterans and two of her nephews have served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
