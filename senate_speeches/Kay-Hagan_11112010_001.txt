United States Senator Kay R. Hagan (D-NC) today commented on Veterans Day, which she will honor by participating in parades in Gastonia and Lexington. 

"Today, we honor our nation's veterans, who courageously stepped forward in times of peril to keep our country safe. In North Carolina and across the nation, these brave men and women put service to their country first, and for that we are forever indebted.

"The great service and sacrifice of America's veterans is carried on by our active duty military, which is working to disrupt, dismantle and defeat terrorists abroad to protect us here at home.

"As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Senator from North Carolina - the most military friendly state in the nation - I am committed to supporting America's brave veterans, our active duty troops and their families."

Hagan comes from a strong military family. Her father-in-law was a two-star Marine general and her father and brother both served in the Navy. Her husband, Chip, is a Vietnam veteran, and two of her nephews have served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
