U.S. Senator Kay R. Hagan today commented on the Final Environmental Impact Statement issued by the National Park Service on off-road vehicle usage at Cape Hatteras National Seashore. Last August, Hagan cosponsored the Preserving Public Access to Cape Hatteras Beaches Act, which would reinstate the Interim Management Plan for off-road vehicles at the Seashore. This plan allows for expanded beach access while balancing important environmental concerns. 

"Beach access is critical to the Dare County economy, and this report overly restricts access to the Hatteras beaches. And it does not appear to reflect the input of local residents and businesses. The Hatteras community has now experienced three summers with many of the most popular beaches closed, and I am very concerned that some local businesses may not survive another.

"I co-sponsored legislation that would resolve this issue by reinstating the Interim Management Plan. It appropriately balances environmental concerns with beach access. I will continue working with my colleagues and all relevant stakeholders to provide beach access and protect the environment."
