 U.S. Senator Kay R. Hagan (D-NC) today joined University of North Carolina President Erskine Bowles and Colonel Richard Anders of the Marine Corps Special Operations Command at the North Carolina Military Foundation's Board of Directors Meeting to highlight the partnership between UNC and the military.

"This groundbreaking partnership is a win-win for the military and the UNC system," said Hagan. "It helps meet the military's emerging needs and creates jobs for North Carolinians by spurring growth in our state's defense contracting industry. I have made it a priority to increase North Carolina's defense contracts and defense-related jobs. I will continue working with the North Carolina Military Foundation to support this partnership, which benefits North Carolina's economy and helps increase the capabilities of the most talented Armed Forces in the world."

UNC and North Carolina-based military commands have multiple collaborative partnerships to support training, increase access to education and provide unique research opportunities for UNC students and faculty. These partnerships are designed to support the military's emerging needs. Hagan, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a long time supporter of the UNC system, discussed congressional support for this collaboration.

The North Carolina Military Foundation works to build the state's defense and homeland security economy.
