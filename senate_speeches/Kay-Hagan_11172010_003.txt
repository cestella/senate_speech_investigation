United States Senator Kay R. Hagan (D-NC) today introduced Judge Max Cogburn, Jr. before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his confirmation hearing. At Hagan's recommendation, President Obama nominated Judge Cogburn in May to be a District Court Judge for North Carolina's Western District. Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) also introduced Judge Cogburn today.

"I recommended Judge Cogburn because of his distinguished record as a jurist and attorney," Hagan said at the hearing. "He has the skills and expertise that this position requires. I am thrilled to be here today to discuss Judge Cogburn's outstanding qualifications to serve on the District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. I will work with my colleague Senator Burr to see that he is confirmed quickly."

Judge Cogburn is currently a Partner at Cogburn & Brazil P.A. in Asheville where he has focused on criminal and civil litigation since early 2006. He served as the U.S. Magistrate Judge for the Western District of North Carolina for nine years and as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the district from 1980-1992. During those 12 years, he was the Lead Attorney in the Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force, as well as the Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney. He has received the American Bar Association's highest rating of well qualified.

In March of last year, Hagan convened a four-person, statewide panel, led by former NC Supreme Court Chief Justice Burley Mitchell, to screen candidates for U.S. District Court Judge and U.S. Attorney positions.
