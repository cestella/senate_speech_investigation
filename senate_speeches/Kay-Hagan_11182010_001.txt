U.S. Senator Kay R. Hagan today spoke on the Senate floor to discuss her successful efforts with Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) to fight for small farmers. Last night, an agreement was reached on the Tester-Hagan amendment to the Food Safety Modernization Act, which is currently being considered by the U.S. Senate. The amendment protects small producers from excessive government regulations in the bill. Yesterday, the Food Safety Bill passed a key procedural hurdle by a vote of 74 to 25. The final version of the bill is likely to be voted on in the Senate by the end of the week.
