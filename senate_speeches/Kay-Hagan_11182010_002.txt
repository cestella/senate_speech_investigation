United States Senator Kay R. Hagan (D-NC) today commented after the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the nomination of Judge Ripley Rand to be U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina. Rand's nomination now awaits confirmation by the full Senate. At Hagan's recommendation, President Obama nominated Judge Rand for the position in July.

"I am thrilled that the Judiciary Committee unanimously sent Judge Rand's nomination to the full Senate," Hagan said. "I recommended Judge Rand because of his distinguished record both as an Assistant District Attorney and a Superior Court Judge. He has been working to ensure justice for North Carolinians for more than a decade, and he will continue to serve our state proudly as a U.S. Attorney. I will work with my colleagues to see that he is swiftly confirmed by the full Senate."

Judge Rand has served as a Superior Court Judge in Wake County since 2002. Prior to his appointment to the bench, he served as an Assistant District Attorney for the Tenth Prosecutorial District in Raleigh.

In March of last year, Hagan convened a four-person statewide panel, led by former N.C. Supreme Court Chief Justice Burley Mitchell, to screen candidates for U.S. District Court Judge and U.S. Attorney positions.
