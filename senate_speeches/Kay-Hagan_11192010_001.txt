U.S. Senator Kay R. Hagan today announced that the Senate unanimously passed a bill to fund the $1.15 billion settlement that black farmers reached with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. The bill now awaits passage by the House.

"The Senate has come through for our country's black farmers," Hagan said. "I have worked with my colleagues to right this wrong for our farmers, and today we are a critical step closer to giving them the justice they deserve. I will continue my efforts to see that a bill including the settlement funding is sent to the President's desk."

Since coming to the Senate, Hagan has been fighting for justice for black farmers in North Carolina and across the country. She has worked closely with Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) to ensure 4,000 African-American farmers in North Carolina and 75,000 nationwide can receive settlements following decades of discrimination by the Department of Agriculture. Hagan also introduced legislation to fund the settlement with Senate Agriculture Chairman Blanche Lincoln (D-AR) and Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA)

In August, Hagan hosted a roundtable discussion in Raleigh on the need to fund the Pigford settlement with John Boyd, President of the National Black Farmers Association, and North Carolina African-American farmers.
