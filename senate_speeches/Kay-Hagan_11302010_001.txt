U.S. Senator Kay R. Hagan, who has been fighting for justice for black farmers since coming to the Senate, today commented on the Pigford bill. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has acknowledged that it unfairly discriminated against African American farmers when they were applying for loans and other USDA programs. The House passed the Senate's Pigford bill today by a vote of 256 to 152, sending it to the President.

"For decades, the federal government has failed to live up to its obligation to our country's African American farmers," said Hagan. "Since coming to the Senate, I have worked with my colleagues to right this wrong for farmers in North Carolina and across the country. Today, we are finally giving our farmers the justice they deserve."

Hagan has worked closely with Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) to ensure 4,000 African-American farmers in North Carolina and 75,000 nationwide can receive settlements following decades of discrimination by the Department of Agriculture. Hagan also introduced legislation to fund the settlement with Senate Agriculture Chairman Blanche Lincoln (D-AR) and Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA). In August, Hagan hosted a roundtable discussion in Raleigh on the need to fund the Pigford settlement with John Boyd, President of the National Black Farmers Association, and North Carolina African-American farmers.

Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack reached a settlement agreement for $1.15 billion with black farmers in February.
