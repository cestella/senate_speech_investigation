In response to the U.S. Department of Education’s denial of an application from Texas Education Commissioner Robert Scott for $830 million from the Education Jobs Fund, U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) released the following statement:

“It is puzzling that a House Democrat chose to unfairly penalize Texas – and Texas alone – by requiring our state to make a commitment for three years of funding, knowing full well that the Texas legislature is constitutionally prohibited from committing funds for a future legislature. As a result, our state will be denied over $800 million in federal funding. Next week, I am introducing legislation to repeal this unfair provision that targets Texas and hampers our state’s educators and schools.”
Sens. Hutchison and John Cornyn (R-Texas) will soon introduce legislation to repeal the Texas-specific provision, which hampers efforts of educators statewide and sends critical Texas taxpayer dollars that should be used in Texas to schools elsewhere by way of the Education Jobs Fund.
The Education Jobs Fund is a new federal program that provides $10 billion in assistance to states to save or create education jobs for the 2010-2011 school year. Jobs funded under this program include those that provide educational and related services for early childhood, elementary, and secondary education.
