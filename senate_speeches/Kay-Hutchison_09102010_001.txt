U.S. Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn, R-Texas, today announced the United States Senate Youth Program (USSYP) has begun accepting applications for the 2011 program. Two Texas students will be selected to join 102 other delegates in Washington, D.C., March 5-12, where they will visit Capitol Hill, the White House, the Pentagon, the State Department, the Supreme Court and other historic sites in Washington. They will meet with Senators, cabinet officers, government leaders and policy-makers. In addition to the all-expenses-paid trip to our nation’s capital, each delegate will also receive a $5,000 undergraduate college scholarship.

“The United States Senate Youth Program is an excellent opportunity for the next generation of Texas leaders to gain a firsthand education about the inner-workings of the U.S. Senate and federal government. We encourage all eligible and interested Texas students to apply for this once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity that will provide a front-row view of Washington leaders at work,” Sens. Hutchison and Cornyn said.
The Texas selection deadline is: October 15, 2010. Interested students in Texas should contact their high school principal or the state-level selection administrator indicated below:
