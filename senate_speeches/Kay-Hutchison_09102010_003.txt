Today, U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) released the following statement on the eve of the 9th anniversary of the September 11 attacks:

“As we remember those who lost their lives on 9/11, let us also think of and thank our troops in harm’s way who are bravely fighting to preserve our security and our liberty. We have not forgotten the events of that day and we will not forget those who continue to serve on behalf of this nation.”
