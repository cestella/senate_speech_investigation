Today, U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) released the following statement on her intent to oppose cloture on the Defense Authorization bill in a vote on Tuesday:

“The Defense Authorization legislation should be a clean bill solely focused on providing for our troops, many of whom are serving in harm’s way in Iraq and Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the Senate Majority Leader is complicating what should be a straightforward piece of legislation by attaching important and unrelated provisions and prohibiting amendments. I will oppose tomorrow’s cloture vote so we can pursue an open process in which all members are able to offer amendments to this critically important bill.”
