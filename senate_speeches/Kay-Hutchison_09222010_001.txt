U.S. Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison, David Vitter, Bill Nelson, Lamar Alexander, Saxby Chambliss, and Johnny Isakson today applauded the Senate’s passage of their bipartisan bill to extend the National Flood Insurance Program through September 30, 2011.

“This one-year extension to the National Flood Insurance Program certainly comes as a relief to communities along the Gulf Coast,” Hutchison said. “I am pleased this bipartisan and timely extension also gives Congress time to get serious about modernizing the program while continuing to allow those living in the floodplains access to flood insurance.”
“I’m really glad that the Senate unanimously passed this one-year extension of the flood insurance program clearing the way for many home sales and giving a boost to our economy without increasing the deficit,” said Vitter. “I know this is a relief for the millions of homeowners who have faced uncertainty throughout this process, and I urge the House to quickly send our bill to the president for his signature.”
“Homebuyers and sellers needing this coverage can now breathe a sigh of relief,” said Nelson.
“This is good news for Tennessee homeowners and small business owners who are still trying to put their lives back together after the May flood, which was the worst natural disaster since President Obama took office, and I urge Congress to pass it,” Alexander said.
“I’m pleased we were successful in passing a one-year extension of the National Flood Insurance Program, which is critical for businesses and homeowners in areas prone to flooding,” said Chambliss. “The recent practice of passing short-term extensions provided unnecessary uncertainty for those who rely on the program.”
“Flood insurance is critically important for the stability of the housing industry and to those Americans seeking this coverage as they purchase a home,” Isakson said. “I’m pleased the Senate has agreed to extend the National Flood Insurance Program for an additional year.”
