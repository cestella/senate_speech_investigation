Today, U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) released the following statement on Department of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar’s decision to lift the moratorium on deepwater drilling off U.S. coasts:
“I have urged the administration to lift this moratorium for months because it threatens energy production jobs for Americans and sends the work overseas. As a result of the moratorium, we know of four deepwater rigs that left the Gulf of Mexico in order to seek opportunities in other countries. I’m glad the moratorium has finally been lifted, though I hope we haven’t lost jobs that will not be replaced.

“I spoke with Secretary Salazar this afternoon to emphasize the need to protect these jobs, and I urged him to prevent further delays and confusing regulations, which could act as a de facto moratorium, much like we have seen with shallow water drilling.”
