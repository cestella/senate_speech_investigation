U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) today applauded the ruling of a federal judge to allow the leading lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the health reform bill’s individual mandate to move forward. The lawsuit is being led by the state of Florida, along with 19 other states including Texas. In December, 2009, at the height of the health care debate, Sen. Hutchison called for a vote to raise the issue of the individual mandate’s constitutionality on the floor of the Senate.

Sen. Hutchison released the following statement:

“With the judge’s ruling today in Florida, states, taxpayers, and small businesses have won another key victory in the battle to reverse the negative consequences of the Obama health care law. This ruling allows the states to challenge the federal mandates and bureaucratic overreach that encompass the health care bill, which has already raised costs, harmed patients’ access to care, and had a chilling effect on business planning.”
