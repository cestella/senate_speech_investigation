Today, U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) released the following statement on the first anniversary of the Fort Hood shooting:

“One year after the tragedy at Fort Hood, those who have been affected are trying to rebuild their lives. For those who made the ultimate sacrifice that day, we will continue to honor their service and preserve their memories,” said Sen. Hutchison. “While the wounds that were inflicted on our nation that day have begun to heal, the threat of terrorism has not abated. It is a sobering reminder that we face a cowardly enemy with no respect for human life.”
