 Today, U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) released the following statement on the release of Aung San Suu Kyi:

“As the soldiers rolled back the barbed wire surrounding her home prison, Aung San Suu Kyi’s release gives hope to the oppressed Burmese people. Her release, however, does not diminish the outrageous human rights record of Burma’s ruling regime. Her unjust captivity by the totalitarian ruling junta could not extinguish her determination to be a light of freedom for her people. She refused to forsake her country at tremendous personal sacrifice, but her spirit was never daunted,” said Senator Hutchison, co-chair, along with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), of the Senate Women’s Caucus on Burma.
