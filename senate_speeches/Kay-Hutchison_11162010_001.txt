To help reduce the federal debt, the Senate Republican Conference today unanimously approved a resolution offered by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) calling for the cancellation “unspent or unobligated federal stimulus funds.”

“Now is the time to halt the stimulus spending that has not spurred growth and has driven America deeper into debt. Every stimulus dollar unspent can reduce future deficits immediately,” Hutchison said after the vote.

Hutchison’s resolution was co-sponsored by Senators Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Mike Johanns (R-NE), Richard Burr (R-NC), Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Scott Brown (R-MA).
