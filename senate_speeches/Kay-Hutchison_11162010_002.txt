Today, U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) released the following statement on her intention to support the earmark moratorium:

“I will be supportive of an earmark moratorium when it comes up for a vote in the Republican Conference as a way to the start the process of reform that is essential to address the crushing debt our country has accumulated. The Republicans in Congress are working to put America’s financial house in order, and it will take comprehensive reform. If Congress does not direct any spending, the president will have 100 percent of the discretion in all federal programs. The failed stimulus is replete with examples of the president’s earmarks that are wasteful and certainly not our nation’s biggest priority. As we reform the budget process, our goal should be to cut overall spending levels, while preventing inappropriately targeted funding by both the administration and Congress. I will offer a resolution at the Republican Conference to return all unspent stimulus funds to avoid future debt, and I will support putting a cap on discretionary spending at 2008 levels.”
