 Senator Kent Conrad and Congressman Earl Pomeroy announced today that North Dakota will receive a $300,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the first round of support for Open Fields, a federal program that provides incentives to farmers and ranchers who voluntarily open their land to hunting, fishing and other wildlife-related activities.
 
“For many, hunting and fishing are a natural part of life in North Dakota,” Pomeory and Conrad said in a joint statement. “Today, however, anglers, hunters and hikers have been limited in their access to open land because, all too often, it is on private land. Open Fields changes that by offering farmers and ranchers voluntary incentives to open their lands.”
 
Open Fields directs the USDA to provide federal funding to those states with existing programs that encourage private landowners – particularly farmers and ranchers – to open their property for hunting, fishing and other outdoor recreational activities on a voluntary basis. The modest payments are designed to be a financial boost to rural America. There are numerous states with access programs, including North Dakota’s PLOTS program.
 
Senator Conrad first introduced Open Fields in the fall of 2003 after hearing from a number of hunters and anglers in North Dakota who had found a lack of free, open land to hunt and fish. Congressman Pomeroy was the  legislation's main champion in the House of Representatives.
 
Open Fields was signed into law as part of the 2008 Farm Bill and included $50 million to fund the program over four years.
 
Nearly 100 million Americans participate in wildlife-related recreation annually, spending in excess of $100 billion each year on outdoor activities.
