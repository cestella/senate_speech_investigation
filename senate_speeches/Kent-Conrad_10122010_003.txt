Speaking today at the annual conference of the North Dakota Association of Counties, Senator Kent Conrad highlighted the role county leaders play in North Dakota's current prosperity.
 
â€œThis August I traveled all across our state.  I held dozens of public meetings and met with hundreds of people.  And I can honestly say that North Dakota has never looked so good. From Williston to Wahpeton, and most every town in between, there is a real energy and sense of optimism," Senator Conrad said.  "Our state's good fortune is a result of a booming energy industry, wise investments of federal resources, and benefits from the 2008 Farm Bill.  But, most of all, it's a result of the determination, sound judgment, and hard work of our people."
 
In his address to county leaders, Senator Conrad highlighted the strong working relationship between North Dakota's congressional delegation and local leadership.  Specifically he noted the numerous projects throughout the state where federal investments have been used wisely to improve the quality of life in many communities.
 
The Senator noted the $234 million per year North Dakota received in the latest highway bill, the $500 million the federal government invested in education in our state last year, and the more than $1 billion dollars for water systems and flood protection North Dakota has received.
 
In August, Senator Conrad visited 45 Counties holding a series of roundtable meetings with leaders across the state focused on both national and local concerns.  The Senator also praised communities large and small for their responsible use of the more than $800 million in federal funding North Dakota received from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
 
Each year, Senator Conrad tries to visit every county in North Dakota. Earlier this week Senator Conrad held an Official Field Hearing of the Senate Budget Committee in Renville County, completing his efforts to visit all 53 counties at least once in 2010.
