Noting the national importance of continued support for the sciences, Senator Kent Conrad today addressed the University of North Dakota's (UND) Neuroscience Symposium. 

"I am a strong supporter of scientific research and ensuring our nation has an adequate medical research budget," said Senator Conrad.  "The work being done here at UND is critically important to our country – especially for those suffering from Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Lou Gehrig’s disease, and traumatic brain injury." 

This year's symposium, entitled “Building Better Brains,” features experts in neuroscience from across the nation. The conference is hosted by the nationally recognized Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) neuroscience group at the UND School of Medicine and Health Sciences.

In his speech, Senator Conrad noted the importance of the federally funded research done at UND, and noted that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was one of the first investors in the COBRE when it awarded a federal grant in 2002.

"Please know that I will continue to support NIH and research programs at UND to ensure that invaluable biomedical research continues," Senator Conrad said.  

As Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Conrad authored a budget resolution earlier this year that provides approximately $32 billion in funding for the NIH.  This funding would help to ensure that important investments for biomedical research continue.
