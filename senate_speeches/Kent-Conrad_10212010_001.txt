 Senator Kent Conrad today met with members of the North Dakota State University's Student Government Association to highlight the importance of public service and discuss the important role the young leaders play as the voice of the student body.

"Our nation faces many difficult challenges, and we need leaders with courage and conviction - regardless of political ideology - to dedicate themselves to helping others.   We need leaders like you," Senator Conrad said.  

NDSU's Student Government  represents the needs and collective voice of the university's student body.  It is divided into executive, legislative, and judicial branches and advocates for policies that will offer top-notch programs, services and resources to students.  Student Government  also works with clubs and student leaders to advance and promote student interests in academic and social life at NDSU.

Student Body President Kevin Black invited Senator Conrad to speak to the Student Government Association and asked the Senator to explain how more young people can get involved in public service.

Senator Conrad spoke to the student leaders about his Public Service Intern Program.  Each semester, Senator Conrad selects North Dakota students, who show aptitude in academics, community service, and leadership, to work in his office in Washington, D.C., and his state offices in Fargo, Bismarck, Grand Forks and Minot.

"We are looking for talented students who are interested in government and public service,” Senator Conrad said. “Our interns get an up-close look at the way the federal government operates. It's a great experience, and I'm glad we can offer it to deserving students."
