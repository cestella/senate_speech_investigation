Senator Kent Conrad today teamed up with the American Red Cross to promote their Holiday Mail for Heroes program. The national program enables the American public to send holiday greetings and messages of thanks to the men and women who serve in the U.S. Armed Forces, veterans, and their families.
 
"So many of America's service members will be away from their loved ones  during the holidays. The Holiday Mail for Heroes program allows North Dakotans to sendthema "touch of home" during the holiday season,"  Senator Conrad said.  "I am honored to partner with the American Red Cross in this very important program."
 
The American Red Cross produced a public service announcement with Senator Conrad to encourage North Dakotans to participate in the effort. The PSA was unveiled today on Senator Conrad's Facebook page and will be distributed to television and radio stations across North Dakota.

Between now and December 10, Senator Conrad is encouraging North Dakotans to send holiday cards to our American service members, their families, and veterans all over the world.  Anyone can send a card and people may send as many as they would like.
Cards should be sent to the following address:
Holiday Mail for Heroes
PO Box 5456
Capitol Heights, MD

Each year the American Red Cross provides assistance to over 2 million service members and many of our nationâ€™s 24 million veterans.
