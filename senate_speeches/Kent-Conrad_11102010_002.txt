Senator Kent Conrad today released the following statement regarding the initial proposal from the bipartisan co-chairs of the President’s Fiscal Commission, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson:

“We have now received a proposal from the bipartisan co-chairs of the President’s Fiscal Commission, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson.  This is not the conclusion of the commission’s work.  This is the beginning.  

“I commend them for putting together a serious proposal.  It reveals just how difficult it is to put the nation on a sound fiscal course.  Some of it I agree with; some I strongly disagree with.  We will have a chance to offer alternatives as we advance the process later today and next week.

“Our task ahead will be difficult, but we must continue to work toward reaching a bipartisan agreement.”
