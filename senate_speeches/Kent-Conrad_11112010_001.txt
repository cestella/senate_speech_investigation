 Senator Kent Conrad released the following statement today commemorating Veterans Day, November 11, 2010.

 
“Throughout our nation’s history America's veterans have put themselves in harm's way to secure our freedom.  Today, we honor all those who face danger and uncertainty to serve in our Armed Forces.
 
"Our veterans served our nation with honor, and their duty is done. Now it’s time for us to do our duty by providing them with the benefits they have earned.  Let us resolve to honor the men and women of our Armed Forces, past and present, not only on Veterans Day but every day.
 
"As we pause today to salute our veterans, we must also honor those who are currently serving.  Today, more than 100 North Dakota National Guard Soldiers are overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq. And thousands of Airmen from Minot Air Force Base and Grand Forks Air Force Base stand guard, ready to defend our nation and preserve our freedom.  To all those in our Armed Forces,  we extend our heartfelt gratitude for your extraordinary service. We are a better nation because of you."
