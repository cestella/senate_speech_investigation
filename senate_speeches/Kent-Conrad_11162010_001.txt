Senator Kent Conrad today announced that he will be accepting applications from students or professionals to fill immediate internship opportunities in his Bismarck and Minot regional offices. Individuals interested in public affairs, political science and constituent service are encouraged to apply.
 
“My internship program offers students a chance to serve North Dakota and their nation,” Senator Conrad said. “An internship in my Bismarck or Minot offices helps students and professionals learn more about the value of public service as they get an up-close view of constituent services and the role of the federal government.”
 
A successful candidate will work on legislative research projects, aid in constituent questions or concerns, and assist the Senator’s staff with various office tasks.
 
In addition to real world experience, each successful candidate will receive a stipend. While full-time applicants are preferred, Senator Conrad is willing to make considerations for student schedules.
 
Each year Senator Conrad selects North Dakotans who demonstrate excellence in academics, community service and leadership to work in his State and Capitol Hill offices. The Senator’s Public Service Internship Program gives students the opportunity to learn about government while serving North Dakota.
