Following the interception of cargo containing explosive materials originating in Yemen and targeting Jewish centers in Chicago, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand issued the following statement:

“Clearly, we need to look at greater surveillance of all air cargo coming from abroad and more security funding for our religious institutions. We must always remain vigilant to all potential terror threats. Authorities have assured me that they are taking all the proper steps to ensure the public’s safety and monitor all aspects of this threat.”

Senator Gillibrand has long pushed for additional federal anti-terror funding to help safeguard civil, religious and community institutions from terrorist attack. Senator Gillibrand helped secure a total of $19 million in federal resources for nonprofits and religious institutions in the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill. Funding for the previous fiscal year for the non-profit program was an insufficient $15 million. In New York State alone, only 55 of 137 applications were able to receive any funding at all.
