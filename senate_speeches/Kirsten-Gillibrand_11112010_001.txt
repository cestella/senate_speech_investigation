 Traveling in Islamabad today, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made the following statement in response to the terrorist bombing in Karachi that killed more than a dozen people this evening.

“I am saddened by the loss of life due to another terrorist attack in Karachi today.  Just today I raised concerns with Pakistan’s top leaders that in order to end the attacks that terrorize the country, the military and intelligence must end safe zones for militants along the border with Afghanistan and improve education and opportunity so that younger generations are not drawn to terrorist organizations.

“These attacks will not stop unless Pakistan becomes a full partner in the fight against terrorism.”

Senator Gllibrand, who is traveling in Afghanistan and Pakistan this week, today met with Pakistan Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani and General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani, Chief of the Army Staff. Earlier in the day, Senator Gillibrand gave a Veteran’s Day address to several hundred troops at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan.
