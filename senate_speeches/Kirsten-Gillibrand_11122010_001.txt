Traveling in Afghanistan and Pakistan, U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand issued the following statement in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision on the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy:

“While this is a disappointing decision, it demonstrates the need for Congress to take action now. The ‘Don't Ask, Don't Tell’ policy undermines our national security, the integrity of our armed services, and the moral foundation upon which this country was founded. We must put our national security first and repeal this corrosive policy now.”
