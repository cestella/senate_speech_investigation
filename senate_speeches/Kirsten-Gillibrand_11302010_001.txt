U.S. Senators Joe Lieberman (I-CT), Mark Udall (D-CO), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) issued the following statement today regarding the Pentagon’s release of a report on repealing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the law that prevents gay Americans from openly serving in the military:

“The Pentagon report makes it unambiguously clear that the risk of repeal on military effectiveness is minimal, that any risks can be addressed by implementing the report’s recommendations, and that a clear majority of active duty servicemen and women have no problem with repeal. The military has spoken and now is the time to repeal this policy that is damaging to our national security.

“The report is the product of one of the most, if not the most,  extensive studies on a military personnel issue that has ever been conducted and its findings demonstrate that we can proceed with repeal of this discriminatory policy in a way that ensures that the U.S. military continues to be the best fighting force in the world. Men and women, regardless of their race, religion, or sexual orientation, who are willing to fight and defend our country should be allowed to do so without fear of discrimination.

“We will continue to work with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to fight to repeal ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ this year. We look forward to the hearings scheduled for later this week where Secretary of Defense Gates, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the chairmen of the Pentagon’s working group, General Counsel Jeh Johnson and General Carter Ham, will present the report to Congress.”
