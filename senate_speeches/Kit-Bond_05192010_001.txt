Mr. President, for weeks now we have been debating the financial reform bill – which is being sold to the American people as the solution to holding Wall Street accountable for the economic crisis that has hurt every American family and business in every community across the nation.
 
Unfortunately, in its current form, this so-called reform will actually punish Main Street America and the families who suffered from – not caused – the financial meltdown.
 
It should be a wakeup call when Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs says Wall Street will be the big winner and the people who provide jobs, especially small businesses, and the people who provide credit to the rest of America are warning of dire consequences. 
 
Let me make this clear:  this bill was meant to reign in Wall Street yet is supported by Goldman Sachs and Citigroup and opposed by small businesses.  I think that tells you all you need to know about this bill.
 
That’s why I rise today in strong opposition to cloture on this bill.  Yes, we have made some improvements to this bill.  I am grateful to my colleague Senator Dodd for working across the aisle with me to remove an onerous provision that would have unintentionally killed small business startups.  Senator Dodd has worked, in good faith, and in a bipartisan fashion to make real changes to this bill.
 
But despite the progress we have made, the provisions most destructive and harmful to taxpayers, families, and small businesses still remain.
 
First – it is completely unbelievable and unacceptable that so many of my colleagues want to turn a blind eye to the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) which contributed to the financial meltdown by buying high risk loans banks made to people who could not afford them. 
 
Everyone here knows what I’m talking about – despite this bill’s 1400-plus pages, it completely ignores the 900 pound gorilla in the room – the need to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or the “toxic twins” as I not so fondly refer to them. 
 
The irresponsible actions by Fannie and Freddie turned the American dream into the American nightmare for too many families who faced foreclosure;
 
The irresponsible actions by Fannie and Freddie devastated entire neighborhoods and communities as property values diminished.
 
To add insult to injury, after Fannie and Freddie went belly up, it was the very Americans who suffered from their irresponsible actions that were left footing the bill.
As if that wasn’t bad enough, unless we act now to reform these Toxic Twins, over the next 10 years, Fannie and Freddie will cost American taxpayers at least an additional $389 billion dollars.   
 
Now, let me put that into perspective – Freddie lost $8 billion dollars in the first quarter of this year, requested an addition $10 billion dollars from taxpayers and warned that it will need more in the future.  This comes on top of the $126 billion that Fannie and Freddie have already lost through the end of 2009. 
 
To make matters worse, this Administration has taken off the $400 billion dollar limit on the federal credit card. 
 
Just how much more do they think Freddie and Fannie can lose?  How much more are they going to force taxpayers to bail out these Toxic Twins?
 
Next, this bill lumps in the good guys with the bad guys and treats them all the same – particularly when it comes to derivatives.
 
When it comes to derivatives, this bill lumps in the folks who are trying to manage risk and control costs with the same folks who are actually speculating in the market to make a buck by making shady bets with money they didn’t have, making insurance bets on property they didn’t own.
 
Now, I’ve heard from folks who say – what exactly does that mean to you and me?
 
That means, for instance, utility companies may not be able to lock in steady rates for their customers, leaving them instead at the whim of the volatile market.
 
Instead of putting money into hiring new workers or building new plants they will have to pay billions to Wall Street or Chicago to “clear” their normal long term contract with energy suppliers through the clearing houses run by big financial firms.  No wonder Wall Street likes this bill!
 
That means you and I, and folks in every community across the country, could pay much higher costs every time you flip on the light switch or turn on the air conditioner.
 
That means family farms may not be able to get long term financing, forcing many to quit farming and preventing many more from ever being started.
 
Quite frankly, I’m stunned that any Senator, in good conscience, would vote for a bill that would increase costs for every American, especially at a time when working families are struggling to make ends meet.
 
Last, I cannot vote for a bill that creates a massive, new super bureaucracy with unprecedented authority to impose government mandates and micromanage any entity that extends credit.
 
We are not just talking about the Goldman Sachs and AIGs of the world.  The ones right at the center of this crisis.  No, in the real world we are talking about your community bank, your car dealer and even your dentist.
 
Don’t be fooled – any of the new costs as a result of the new mandates and regulations will be passed on to consumers – the very people this bill seeks to protect.
 
Under this new super bureaucracy – the misnamed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau –will safety and soundness requirements for healthy banks give way to the prevailing political agenda of the new bureaucracy? 
 
Will this new bureaucracy have access to your and my personal bank records? 
 
Will State Attorney Generals go after community banks? 
 
Much like the healthcare bill recently signed into law, I fear that small businesses will soon learn of many more unintended consequences which have yet to be seen. 
 
To sum it up, if the goal here is to enact real reform that ensures that we never ever have another financial crisis like the one we had 18 months ago, the bill falls woefully short of that goal. 
 
This bill is light on reform and heavy on overreach and unintended consequences.  My colleagues should oppose cloture and continue working to pass bipartisan amendments that will make changes to the destructive provisions I outlined above.
 
There is no doubt we need to protect every day Americans from ever again falling victim to a Wall Street-Gone-Wild.
 
But what we don’t want, and why this debate is so important, is to punish these same every day Americans for a crisis they didn’t cause.
 
And unless we succeed at changing it, the Democrats’ bill will do just that and the costs will be paid by Main Street.
