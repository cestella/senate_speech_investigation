U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today made this statement on his opposition to the DISCLOSE Act.

"The DISCLOSE Act is a political sham. It seeks to impose new campaign laws right before an election, a rare occurrence in American politics. At the end of the day, it's really all about partisan advantage.

"I think it's also a bit odd that President Obama would lecture the Congress on this issue. In 2008, he broke his promise to accept public financing in the presidential race and then proceeded to raise $750 million. For him to now express concern about money in politics is a little late."
