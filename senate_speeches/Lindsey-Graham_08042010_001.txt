U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) has cosponsored legislation to dramatically reduce the paperwork burden placed on small businesses in South Carolina under the Obama health care plan.  

Under the health care law, small businesses, churches, charities, and state and local governments, would be required to track their purchases and file 1099 forms with the IRS for every transaction with another business over $600.  This includes everything from office supplies to basic services.  

“The health care bill had many terrible provisions and this is among the worst,” said Graham.  “The paperwork requirement the Obama health care bill will put on even the smallest businesses in South Carolina will be devastating.  Instead of small business owners spending their time growing their business, they will spend time filling out more government paperwork.”  

“I appreciate Senator [Mike] Johanns’ introduction of this important legislation and am hopeful we will soon take it up in the Senate,” said Graham.  “Passage of this legislation will take a tremendous burden off the backs of small businesses.  The paperwork burden is yet another example of why the Obama health care bill should be repealed and replaced.”  

The legislation is S.3578, The Small Business Paperwork Mandate Elimination Act, by Senator Mike Johanns (R-Nebraska).  Senator Graham is one of 19 co-sponsors of the legislation.
