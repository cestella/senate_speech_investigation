U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) said he was pleased the Senate approved a resolution he introduced recognizing this week, September 12 – September 18, as “National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week.”  

The Graham resolution calls on Americans to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs to demonstrate support for HBCUs.  

“Historically Black Colleges and Universities provide quality educational experiences and play a vital role in an increasingly complex and highly technological society,” said Graham.  “HBCUs have a rich heritage and have played a prominent role in the history of the United States. Further, they have allowed many students to attain their full potential through higher education. I am pleased the Senate has come together in a bipartisan fashion to recognize the contributions and accomplishments of these institutions.”  

Two major HBCU Associations – the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) and the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education – were active in supporting the resolution.  

“HBCUs have a proven record of attracting and graduating talented students, and preparing them for careers of success and service,” said Michael L. Lomax, UNCF president and CEO.  “So if America wants to invest in the next generation of college-educated scientists, engineers, teachers, and business leaders, there’s no better investment than HBCUs and the students who attend them.”   

South Carolina is home to eight Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  A complete list can be found at http://www.ed.gov/about/inits/list/whhbcu/edlite-list.html.
