U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today made this statement on the resignation of the President’s National Security Adviser, General James L. Jones.  

“I very much appreciate the service of General Jones to our nation.  I’ve known Jim for many years, and he has a true love of country.  He has provided the President valuable and sound national security advice during his tenure.   

“I believe the President has chosen wisely in the selection of Mr. Donilon to replace General Jones.  As Deputy National Security Adviser, Tom is fully aware of the responsibilities ahead and will be able to take up where General Jones left off.  In my dealings with Mr. Donilon, I have found him to be very professional, open to suggestions, and fully committed to America’s national security.  I look forward to working with him to ensure our nation stays secure.   

“I will continue to do all in my power to foster bipartisan cooperation when it comes to our national security, the needs of our men and women in uniform, and a successful outcome in the ongoing War on Terror.”
