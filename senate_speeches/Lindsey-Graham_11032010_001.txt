U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today made this statement on the passing of Bob Fulton, the longtime voice of the South Carolina Gamecocks.
 
“Bob Fulton’s passing is not just a blow to Gamecock Nation, but something that will be mourned by all South Carolinians who love college athletics.  

“There was nothing more exciting than to listen to Bob Fulton describe the trials and tribulations of the South Carolina Gamecocks.  He had one of the most recognizable voices in the state and an unmatched passion for the university.  Bob Fulton was a fine man, a good friend, and like his friend and colleague Jim Phillips from Clemson, a legend in the South Carolina sports world.”
