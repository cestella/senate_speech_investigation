Right on cue with the helicopter!  

From my point of view, the formation of the government is within sight, and possible sooner, rather than later.  But we’ve got to remember what this opportunity presents for Iraq.  It’s a chance to solidify this country’s future for decades to come.  A lot of blood and treasure has been spent to get us to this moment.  So I have urged every Iraqi leader to think about the future of your country in broad terms, not narrow terms.  

What does it take for Iraq to survive in the future?  It’s got to be accepted by regional partners and players as a legitimate government.  What we are talking about here is basically a Shia coalition, an Arab-Shia coalition, governing a Mideast nation for the first time in history.  And it has to be broad, and it has to be inclusive.  The Sunni-Arab states in this region have to look at Iraq as a friend, a partner, and an ally.  And I do believe there is a tremendous amount of future investment potential for Sunni-Arab states in Iraq if the government is formed in a proper manner.  

This country needs a healthy relationship with Iran.  They are their neighbor.  We all understand that.  And a healthy relationship would be one where Iran respects the sovereignty of Iraq.  

And the United States, in my view, needs an enduring relationship with this nation called Iraq.  We have fought hard alongside the Iraqi people.  We have lost over 4,000 young Americans in this fight for freedom.  And I hope that we can have an enduring relationship that begins in 2012 with a new agreement that has political, military, and economic cooperation as far as the eye can see.  

There is a lot of difficulty finding bipartisanship in Washington at this moment on the domestic side, but I am here to say that we have an independent Democrat and two Republicans who are very supportive of what President Obama and his team is trying to do here in forming this new government in Iraq.  And I am very proud of what the Administration has been doing.  And now is the time to get it done.  And I do believe that is possible, if everybody will have a broad vision of Iraq, not a narrow vision of Iraq.  

That’s a very good question.  
 
Well, the one thing that we have told our Iraqi friends is that we have a new Congress.  We had a sea-change election, and a lot of the Members of this new Congress really never spoke about foreign policy.  There was never a real debate about what should we do, as a nation, in terms of our future involvement with Iraq?  

The three of us are committed – and we told Prime Minister Maliki, Abdul-Mahdi, and we will tell Barzani today – that you need to help us.  We’re here to help both nations, Iraq and the United States, to make the case for a continued involvement in Iraq.  We need to tell our colleagues at home that this new government is broad, inclusive, and it can succeed.  

To the new Members of Congress:  Please understand how important it is for Iraq to become the successful, stable state.  It is a sea-change in world politics.  This is the place where Muslims took up arms against al-Qaeda and delivered them a decisive blow.  But the battle is not yet over, as you can see by the ballots.  

So, I will do all I can, along with Senators McCain and Lieberman, to persuade our colleagues that we need a continued relationship and investment with this country politically, economically, and militarily.  What’s about to happen in Iraq is a game-changer that makes America much safer.  

This is the place where Muslims stood up to al-Qaeda and said, “No.”  This is the place where you can have a democracy between Syria and Iran that will change the future of the Mideast.  This is the place where Sunnis and Shia are sitting down together and sharing power, and having a common view of how to move forward with their Kurdish friends.  What happens here in Iraq for years to come really is a vital national security interest to the United States.  Now is not time to lose sight of that vision.
