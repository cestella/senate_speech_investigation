U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) today made this statement on the trial of Ahmed Ghailani.

"While I respect the judgment of the court, I'm deeply disappointed in the verdict.

"We are at war with Al Qaeda.  Members of the organization, and their associates, should be treated as warriors, not common criminals.  We put our nation at risk by criminalizing the war.

"Going forward, I once again strongly encourage the Obama Administration to use military commissions to prosecute enemy combatants, particularly the 9/11 conspirators like Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba."
