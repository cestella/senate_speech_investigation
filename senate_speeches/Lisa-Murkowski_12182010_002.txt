WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, released the following statement today after voting to end debate and move to consideration of a bill that would repeal the military’s Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy. A final vote on the measure will likely occur on Monday, and Murkowski will vote for the measure.

“I am pleased that the Senate voted today to end debate on the President’s proposal to repeal the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy and allow gay and lesbian service members to serve openly in the military. I intend to vote yes on repeal when that final vote comes to the Senate floor. Our military leaders have made a compelling case that they can successfully implement a repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. It is infinitely preferable for Congress to repeal the law, and allow the service chiefs to develop and execute a new policy, than to invite a court-ordered reversal of the law with no allowance for a military-directed implementation. I’ve heard from Alaskans across the state who believe it’s time to end this discriminatory policy, and I agree with them.”
