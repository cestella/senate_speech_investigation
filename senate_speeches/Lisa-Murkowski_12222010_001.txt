WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, today voted for the James Zadroga 9/11 Act that would provide health monitoring, treatment and compensation to police, firefighters, emergency medical personnel and other responders who were involved in the response to the events of September 11, 2001. Murkowski issued the following statement after the bill was unanimously passed by the Senate:

“Next September marks the 10th anniversary of the tragic events of September 11, 2001. In the years that have passed we have sadly come to learn that the death toll from the events of September 11th continues to mount. I am deeply saddened by reports that some of the patriotic Americans who responded to the events of September 11th have died from exposure to toxic materials while participating in 9/11 response and recovery efforts. Many other responders are suffering from chronic, and in some cases, career ending adverse health issues resulting from this exposure. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act is about fulfilling our nation’s moral responsibility to the first responders from Alaska and every other state who responded to the events of September 11th at substantial risk to their own safety. My office has been working behind the scenes for weeks to encourage the Senate to enact this bill before we leave for Christmas. I am pleased that senators from both sides of the aisle came together in an agreement that does justice to the sacrifices of our first responders. Some will regard passage of the James Zadroga Act in the closing hours of this congressional session as a Christmas miracle. I simply view it as the right thing to do.”
