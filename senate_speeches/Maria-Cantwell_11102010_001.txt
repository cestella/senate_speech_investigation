Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) announced that 25 surplus computers she helped secure will be delivered to five Washington state public schools next week. The five schools nominated in Washington state that will receive five computers each are: Wahkiakum High School (Cathlamet), Aki Kurose Middle School (Seattle), Stevens Middle School (Pasco), Tonasket High School (Tonasket), and Mountain View Middle School (Bremerton). The computers are scheduled to be delivered by November 19. Cantwell secured the computers through the Computers for Schools Program, which allows Senators to donate surplus computers from the United States Senate.
 
“Over the past decade, computers have proven essential in preparing our students to succeed in a global economy heavily dependent on technology,” said Senator Cantwell. “I know these worthy Washington schools will put these surplus computers to good use in helping prepare our students to enter the workforce of tomorrow on the cutting-edge.”   
 
Created in 1999, the United States Senate's Computer for Schools Program helps public schools take advantage of the information technology age by channeling surplus computers into classrooms across the country. Senators may donate up to 25 computers to public schools in their state that have registered with the program, and donations must be made in groups of five. Only public schools are eligible.
