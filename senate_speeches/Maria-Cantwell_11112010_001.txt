U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) released the following statement today on the passing of Dave Niehaus:
 
“Dave Niehaus brought joy and excitement to Seattle baseball fans for generations.  Listening to him was like listening to radio magic. His award by the Hall of Fame recognized what we in the Northwest already knew: He was one of the best broadcasters who ever lived.

“There is no replacing Dave Niehaus.  We give thanks for the lifetime of memories he has given each of us.  He called the big moments in Mariners history, but it was the way he called them that made them so special.

 “My heart goes out to his family and the entire Seattle Mariners extended baseball family. The sound of his voice will always be with us. We will miss you Dave.”
