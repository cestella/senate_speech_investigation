Today, U.S. Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Patty Murray (D-WA) introduced a resolution honoring Mariners Broadcast legend Dave Niehaus. Niehaus led the play-by-play announcing of the Mariners from their inaugural season in 1977 through the 2010 season. 
 
“From the very first Mariners game he called, Dave Niehaus was more than just the voice of the Mariners, he was the soul of the team,” said Senator Cantwell. “We cherish the lifetime memories Dave gave us, from the ‘My oh mys!’ to the ‘Grand salamis.’  His voice will always be with us.”
 
“Dave Niehaus was the heart and soul of Mariners baseball and the games won’t be the same without his colorful play-by-play announcing,” said Senator Patty Murray. “Generations of Washington state families have associated his voice and personality with their hometown team, and he will be missed greatly.”
 
Niehaus passed away November 10 at age 75. He is survived by his wife, three children and six grandchildren. During his illustrious career, he called nearly every game in Mariners history, doing the play by play for 5,284 of the 5,385 Mariners games that have been played.  In 2000, he was the second individual inducted into the Mariners Hall of Fame.
