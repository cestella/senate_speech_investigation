Today U.S. Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Patty Murray (D-WA) released the following statements observing the one-year anniversary of the fatal shooting of four Lakewood police officers in the line of duty. 
 
“One year ago today, a senseless tragedy claimed the lives of four of Washington state’s finest. We remember Lakewood Police Sergeant Mark Renninger and Officers Ronald Owens, Tina Griswold, and Greg Richards as heroes who gave their lives in service to their community,” said Senator Cantwell. “Today’s anniversary reminds us of the tremendous risks police officers take every day to keep our communities safe, and of the sacrifices they and their families make every day.  On this day of remembrance, my thoughts and prayers are with their fellow officers, their friends and families, as well as the entire Lakewood community.
 
“One year ago, Washington state was shocked and saddened by news of the deadliest attack on law enforcement in our state’s history. It was a senseless and brutal killing that targeted four members of the City of Lakewood Police Department – people who put their lives on the line everyday to keep us all safe,” said Senator Murray. “We will never forget their sacrifice, and today we thank law enforcement officers across Washington state for their unparalleled commitment to protecting our communities.”
