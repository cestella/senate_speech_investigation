Securing the world’s nuclear arsenals is essential to strengthening America’s national security and preventing these weapons from falling into the wrong hands. The New START treaty will help reduce nuclear dangers and make our country safer, and has received widespread support from military and foreign policy leaders past and present. I am pleased that the Senate was able to put partisanship aside and come together to ratify this important treaty for the good of our nation and the world.
