Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Mark Udall issued the following statement calling on Congress to use the report by the President’s commission on reducing the national debt as a starting point for discussion about how to get America’s fiscal house in order:
 
“I don’t agree with every recommendation, but the report by the President’s bipartisan debt-reduction commission is a critical first step toward addressing one of the most serious threats to our national security and future prosperity. 
 
“While the report didn’t receive enough support today to trigger a mandatory vote by Congress, it still deserves to be considered by Congress.  I firmly believe that we can’t let this become yet another report that sits on the shelf to gather dust.  Today, I’m calling on both parties and the President to pick up the ball and get serious about our ballooning debt.  Let’s use this plan as a starting point for action to reduce our debt and get our fiscal house in order.”
