Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Mark Udall voted to extend tax relief for working families.  In a series of votes, Republicans blocked action, insisting on adding tax breaks for the wealthiest one-half of 1 percent of Americans.
 
Udall issued this statement following today’s votes:
 
“With American families struggling to get by every week, it’s irresponsible for Republicans to hold hostage middle-class relief in order to ensure the wealthiest among us receive further tax cuts.  Our focus should be creating jobs, strengthening the economy, and paying down the debt – and there are many better ways to do so other than tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires.
 
“It’s time for the Senate to stop playing games and get down to business.  Not only should we pass middle-class tax relief, we need to pass a defense bill that is critical for our troops and our national security, as well as vote on several other pieces of important legislation.  Both parties need to stop talking and start making the tough decisions we were elected to make.  I’m ready to work nights, weekends and over the holidays to fight for our men and women in uniform and to help working families.”
