Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Mark Udall is working with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to expand the market in Mexico for U.S.-grown potatoes, a move that would support new jobs in Colorado, particularly in the San Luis Valley region. Currently, U.S. growers are allowed to sell potatoes in a limited area within 26 kilometers of the U.S./Mexico border. This restriction is in place despite an agreement made in 2003 to discuss expanding the market to all of Mexico.

In a letter to Vilsack, Udall emphasized that, according to industry estimates, if U.S. potato growers had full access to the Mexican market, total exports could exceed $130 million annually, supporting more jobs, particularly in agriculture. The letter was timed to coincide with a meeting scheduled for Thursday and Friday between Vilsack and his Mexican counterpart.

"This situation has been frustrating for Colorado potato growers who have watched efforts to fully implement the potato agreement languish," Udall wrote in the letter, which was also signed by U.S. Senator Michael Bennet. "This frustration has increased because the internal movement of potatoes in Mexico is based on a national standard offered to Mexican growers that is not available to U.S. growers.... As strong trading partners, we encourage you to work with Mexican officials to address what many view as a violation of the â€˜national treatment' standard of international trading rules and work to allow full access for U.S. potatoes."
