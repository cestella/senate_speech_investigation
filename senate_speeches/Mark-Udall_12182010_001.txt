Today the U.S. Senate overcame a Republican filibuster – by a vote of 63 to 33 – to advance toward final passage a bipartisan bill to repeal the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell law.  Mark Udall, who has been a leader in the effort to repeal this outmoded law and sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, made the following statement:

“The U.S. Senate today took a big step toward boosting our national security and allowing proud Americans to serve their country in the armed services, no matter whether they are straight or gay.  I’m proud to have helped lead this legislative effort and to be a primary cosponsor of the repeal bill.  The fight hasn’t been easy, but as U.S. Defense Secretary Gates strongly urged, not only must Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell be repealed, but Congress should act before the end of this year.

“I thank the small group of Republican senators who broke ranks and refused to filibuster this repeal bill.  In the coming days, I am confident that the Senate will take the last step and finally pass the full repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”
