Today, Mark Udall urged his Senate colleagues to follow his lead and vote for the DREAM Act. While the bill failed because it was filibustered by opponents, Udall will continue to support efforts to pass it so that all young people can earn the opportunity to realize the American dream.

Udall released the following statement:

"This is an important issue that affects the lives of so many young people who only want the opportunity to live the American dream - and know of no other home than the United States. This bill would have enabled high-achieving students the opportunity to further their education or fight for our country. Many military leaders agree that passing this legislation would help strengthen our military by giving these young men and women the chance to serve in the armed forces.

"Today's vote should have been an opportunity to put politics aside, but instead some will use it as a political tool to further divide our country."
