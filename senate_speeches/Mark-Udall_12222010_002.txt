Today Mark Udall attended a Presidential signing ceremony for a new law that allows the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell." Udall, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was one of a core group of bipartisan U.S. senators who led the historic repeal effort to allow Americans to serve in the U.S. military, regardless of their sexual orientation. Americans overwhelmingly support the repeal which passed the Senate by a vote of 65-31.

The U.S. Department of Defense is now tasked with implementing the new policy in an orderly manner that does not harm troop readiness, cohesion, recruitment or retention. Udall made the following statement:

"As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I watched with pride today as the President signed his name on the law that will bring an end to â€˜Don't Ask, Don't Tell.' There is more work to do, and I will continue to exercise my oversight duties to ensure that the U.S. Department of the Defense implements the repeal in a way that doesn't diminish the effectiveness of our military or the safety of our troops, especially as we continue to fight two wars. But in the meantime, Democrats and Republicans alike have sent a powerful message that never again will someone's sexual orientation preclude them from protecting our great nation."
