Today, Mark Udall released the following statement following the Bureau of Land Management's announcement this afternoon about a new policy ensuring the balanced management of public lands:

"Since 2003, wild and untrammeled lands managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Colorado have been threatened because of a policy adopted in the state of Utah that prevented the BLM from periodically reviewing its lands-through an open and public process-for their eligibility as wilderness and managing them for such qualities until Congress could designate them as wilderness areas. Since that time, I have been urging the BLM to revise this policy so that it can identify and manage lands in Colorado that possess important wild characteristics. So, I welcome this announcement allowing the BLM to identify and manage lands for important open, wild and pristine values. I applaud Secretary Salazar for his leadership in working to affirm that the protection of these lands is a high priority for the BLM, and is an integral component of its land and resource planning and multiple-use mission."
