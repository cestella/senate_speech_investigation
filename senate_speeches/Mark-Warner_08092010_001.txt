The Defense Department has announced plans to shut-down one of its 10 major military commands. Defense Secretary Robert Gates wants to eliminate the Joint Forces Command, a Hampton Roads-based command which trains troops from different services to fight together.

"I can see no rational basis for dismantling JFCOM since its sole mission is to look for efficiencies and greater cost-savings by forcing more cooperation among sometimes competing military services," Senator Warner said in response to the news.

“JFCOM also has served an important role as the anchor for Virginia’s investments and increasing profile in the modeling and simulation industry."

“In the business world, you sometimes have to spend money in order to save money.

“We will work together as a congressional delegation to see what we can do to maintain as many of these JFCOM jobs as possible in southeastern Virginia."
