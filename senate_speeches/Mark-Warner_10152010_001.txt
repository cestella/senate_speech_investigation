Washington, D.C. -- U.S. Senators Jim Webb and Mark Warner today announced $148 million in federal grants to Virginia agencies, municipalities, and public safety organizations.  The 296 U.S. Department of Justice grants support public safety projects across the Commonwealth of Virginia.

“Given the difficult economic climate and the budget shortfalls facing local governments, this critical funding will provide uninterrupted law enforcement services and will spur innovation and efficiency in public safety,” said Senator Webb, author of the National Criminal Justice Act, which would create a bipartisan commission to review the criminal justice system and offer concrete recommendations for reform. 

“Especially in a time of tight budgets, these grants provide much-needed support for vital public safety programs across Virginia,” Senator Warner said. “These funds will help us better support victims of crime, equip our front-line law enforcement officers, and provide additional investment in the longer-term modernization of Virginia’s criminal justice system.”  

The Department of Justice has three grant making components: the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), and the Office of Justice Programs (OJP). 

The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) is the largest grant making arm of the Department of Justice. For Fiscal Year 2010, Virginia received 266 awards totaling $138.4 million in OJP grants to help Virginia prevent and control crime, administer justice, and assist victims.

For Fiscal Year 2010, the Commonwealth of Virginia received 16 OVW grants totaling more than $7.4 million. To view the entire list of OVW grand awards in Virginia, please click here.
Within the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program, Virginia received eight awards totaling more than $500,000 from the Secure Our Schools (SOS) grant program, which focuses on improving safety by preventing school violence in and around schools. Six grants totaling more than $1.6 million were awarded to Virginia through the COPS Hiring Program, enabling local law enforcement agencies in the Commonwealth to hire and/or rehire full-time sworn officers to increase their community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts.
