WASHINGTON: U.S. Senators Jim Webb and Mark Warner today announced that Virginia has been awarded $45.4 million in federal transportation grants to launch preliminary engineering and an environmental impact assessment to develop high-speed passenger rail service between Richmond/Petersburg and Washington, D.C. Senators Webb and Warner worked with the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transit (VDRPT) to secure these funds through the Federal Railroad Administration. The ultimate goal is to provide 85-100 mph rail service that will allow passengers to travel the 115-miles in about 90 minutes.

“I worked with Virginia officials to secure these funds because high-speed passenger rail promises significant economic benefits for Richmond and the Commonwealth,” said Senator Webb. “These funds will spur job creation and economic growth, while reducing traffic on our highways in a cost effective way.”

“This funding helps build on the effort to bring high-speed rail to Virginia and along the entire Southeastern U.S.,” Senator Warner said. “Improved passenger rail service along the Interstate 95 corridor will reduce highway congestion, conserve energy, shorten travel times and create economic development opportunities.”

The grant will allow VDRPT to begin preliminary engineering and environmental documentation for the Richmond-to-Arlington section of the federally designated Southeast High Speed Rail (SEHSR) corridor linking Washington to Charlotte, N.C. The SEHSR project proposes to implement approximately 162 miles of high speed rail as part of an overall plan to extend high speed passenger rail service from the Northeast Corridor (Boston to Washington, D.C.) southward through Virginia to Charlotte, NC.
