WASHINGTON â€” United States Senators Mary L. Landrieu, D-La., and Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., co-chairs of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, today praised the Senate passage of S. Res. 647 last night. Introduced by Inhofe and Landrieu, S. Res. 647 expresses the support for the goals of National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month by promoting national awareness of adoption and the children awaiting families, celebrating children and families involved in adoption, and encouraging Americans to secure safety, permanency, and well-being for all children.    

"There is nothing more important for a child than to be raised in a supporting and loving family," Landrieu said. "A family is where children are taught values that serve as the foundation of lifelong decisions, where they gain a sense of belonging and find confidence in themselves. For more than a decade, tireless judges, attorneys, child advocates and hundreds of volunteers around the country dedicate National Adoption Day to changing lives. They are giving these children a permanent place to call home."
"I commend my Senate colleagues for supporting this effort to recognize and honor both National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month," Inhofe said. "My hope remains that this resolution will raise much-needed awareness to the most vulnerable set of people in our nation - the orphans. As a grandfather of an adopted child from Ethiopia, I remain dedicated to assisting the efforts of families who wish to adopt domestically and abroad. May we never forget the children who need help the most and continue to improve the adoption system to ensure these children find homes."
