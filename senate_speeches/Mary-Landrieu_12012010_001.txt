WASHINGTON — United States Senator Mary L. Landrieu, D-La., today responded to the announcement by Department of the Interior Secretary Ken Salazar of the administration’s updated oil and gas leasing program for the Outer Continental Shelf. 
Sen. Landrieu said:

“Today’s announcement by Secretary Salazar to limit areas in the Atlantic and Eastern Gulf of Mexico is major step backwards for our nation’s energy security.  The original 5-year plan, when it was announced in March, signaled that this administration was serious about jobs and our nation’s energy security.  Unfortunately, despite the rigorous new safety regulations that are now required as a result of the Deepwater Horizon accident, this Administration has decided to make a U-turn. 
“The only glimmer of good news is that BOEM plans to move forward with drilling off the coast of Alaska.  I appreciate BOEM’s expeditious review, but there are other agencies involved with this decision, and I encourage them to expedite their reviews as well so that this activity can finally move forward.”
