WASHINGTON â€” United States Senator Mary L. Landrieu, D-La., today issued the following statement after voting to convict Louisiana District Judge G. Thomas Porteous on all four of the House of Representatives' Articles of Impeachment and to disqualify him from holding any future federal office.

Sen. Landrieu said:

"Because of the overwhelming evidence presented to the Senate during this trial, I am convinced that Judge Porteous actively engaged in illegal kickback schemes that benefitted him and other family members, while serving as a state Judge.  As a nominee to the federal bench, he submitted false statements to the Senate Judiciary Committee about these matters, as well as about his troubling illegal gambling habits and his extreme gambling debts.  Judge Porteous has brought disgrace and shame upon himself.  He has harmed the reputation of the federal bench and violated the trust of the people of Louisiana.

"Our system of justice, particularly a seat on the federal bench, demands the highest ethical standard, a standard that Judge Porteous failed to reach.  That is why I voted to convict him on all four Articles of Impeachment and voted to further disqualify him from holding any future federal office."
