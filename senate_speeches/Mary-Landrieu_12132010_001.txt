WASHINGTON â€” United States Senator Mary L. Landrieu, D-La., today issued the following statement after voting for cloture on the Tax Hike Prevention Act of 2010.

Sen. Landrieu said:

"It is because I strongly support portions of the Tax Hike Prevention Act of 2010 directed towards extending tax relief to middle-class families and small businesses, and it is because of provisions like the child tax credit and the employer-provided child care tax credit that really help low and middle income families, that I voted to advance the debate on this package.

"I continue to hold out hope that changes can be made, particularly with respect to households earning more than $1 million a year, but on balance, it is important to maintain the lowest possible tax rates for the middle class during this recession in hopes of promoting a fast recovery.
 
"As we advance the debate on this bill, I hope there will be changes and I will be working with other Gulf Coast senators to extend the placed-in-service deadline of the GO Zone low-income housing tax credit, which is my top priority."
