WASHINGTON â€” United States Senator Mary L. Landrieu, D-La., responded to today's announcement by the U.S. Department of Justice that the U.S. government filed a lawsuit against BP and four other companies for their roles in the oil spill that resulted from the April 20th explosion of the Deepwater Horizon.

Sen. Landrieu said:

"BP should be held accountable for the damage the oil spill inflicted upon the Gulf Coast.  I remain committed to ensuring that no less than 80% of the penalties BP pays are directed to the Gulf Coast and that the money is divided among the states based on need and the damage they incurred from the spill.  I will be working with the rest of the Louisiana delegation and fighting for legislation to accomplish this goal in January."
