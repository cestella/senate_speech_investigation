WASHINGTON â€” United States Senator Mary L. Landrieu, D-La., today issued the following statement after voting for the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010.

Sen. Landrieu said:

"I still have serious concerns about borrowing nearly $50 billion to extend tax cuts for people making more than $1 million a year, but I reluctantly voted for the tax cut compromise because I strongly support extending lower tax rates for middle and working class Louisianians.  The bill also contained a necessary extension of long-term unemployment benefits to help Americans who are out of work pay the rent, keep the lights on and feed their families while they look for a job.  

"The bill has much room for improvement and I hope changes can be made in the House and into the next Congress.  Thanks to commitments from Senators Baucus and Kyl, that work will begin early next year by swiftly extending the Go Zone Low-Income tax credits through 2012."
