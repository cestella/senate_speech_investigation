WASHINGTON â€” United States Senator Mary L. Landrieu, D-La., issued the following statement today after her vote to invoke cloture on a bill that will repeal the military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy.  The cloture motion passed by a vote of 63-33.  The Senate will vote on final passage later this afternoon.

Sen. Landrieu said:

"Creating an environment where all members of our military can be open and honest about themselves will encourage more Americans to volunteer for military service, which only strengthens our fighting force.  We should be grateful to any American who wants to serve our country and put their life on the line to defend the freedoms and democracy we enjoy.  They deserve our support and should not be subjected to bigotry and discrimination.  I'm glad the Senate will pass this bill today with bipartisan support."
