WASHINGTON â€” United States Senator Mary L. Landrieu, D-La., issued the following statement today after her vote to ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with Russia.  The Senate ratified the treaty, which was signed by President Obama on April 8, by a vote of 71-26.     

Sen. Landrieu said:       

"Ratifying the New START Treaty is vital to our nation's security.  It will ensure that the United States can resume inspections of Russia's nuclear arsenal - something we have not been able to do since December 2009.  The treaty has bipartisan support among Senators, and top military and national security leaders, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen, the head of the U.S. Strategic Command General Kevin Chilton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates.                                

"Our allies around the world want to see that the United States is serious about promoting peace through the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.   As we move forward with the implementation of this treaty, I will continue to ensure Global Strike Command, located in Bossier Parish, and Barksdale Air Force Base play important roles in maintaining the nuclear triad and the security of our nation."
