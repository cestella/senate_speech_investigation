Michael Bennet, U.S. Senator for Colorado and cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, made the following statement on Equal Pay Day, which represents how far into the year a woman must work, on average, to earn as much as a man earned the previous year. For example, on average, a woman would have had to work from January 1, 2009 until April 20, 2010, for her wages to match what a man would have earned from January 1 to December 31, 2009.

"All Americans, regardless of who they are or where they come from, deserve a level of pay that fully reflects the scale of their effort. That's why I voted for the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and am a cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, both of which will help ensure everyone, regardless of race or gender, gets equal pay for equal work. But this day is a reminder that we still have a lot of work to do.

"In this savage economy, when families are already struggling to make ends meet, the last thing people can afford is to be paid less because of who they are. An economy that discriminates against women leaves families with fewer dollars to spend and fewer dollars to save. Hardworking Americans and their families deserve better."
