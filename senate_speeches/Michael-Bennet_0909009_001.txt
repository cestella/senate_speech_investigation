Michael Bennet, U.S. Senator for Colorado, released the following statement today on President Obama's Joint Address to Congress on health care.

"Tonight, President Obama reminded us of exactly what is at stake in the health care debate and of why we owe it to the American people to enact reform that makes a meaningful departure from a status quo that isn't working for families and small businesses.

"In my travels across the state, I heard story after story of people who simply can't sustain another decade of soaring health care costs that are crushing working families and small businesses, crippling our economy and driving our country further into debt."

"While some of us may disagree on the right prescription for reform, we all need to recognize that the status quo is unacceptable - for working families, for small businesses, and for our economy - and that the need for change is now."
