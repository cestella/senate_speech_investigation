Michael Bennet, U.S. Senator for Colorado, released the following statement on Assistant Secretary for Aging Kathy Greenlee's visit to Colorado for the 25th National Home and Community-Based Services Conference. Bennet is a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging.

"Coloradans and people across the country work hard all their lives in the hopes that they can retire comfortably and with dignity. It's part of the American dream, a promise that's lured generation after generation to our country to work, live and raise a family in towns and cities across America.

"As a member of the Senate's Special Committee on Aging, I'm working to ensure that dream remains within reach for current and future generations of Coloradans. I know the efforts of Assistant Secretary Greenlee and conference attendees will help us move forward as we work toward this very important goal."
