Michael Bennet, U.S. Senator for Colorado, released the following statement after legislation that would freeze interest rates on existing balances until credit card reform is implemented in February was blocked on the Senate floor:

"Coloradans can't wait a moment longer for common-sense credit card reform. Hard working families continue to get hit by unfair interest rate hikes as credit card companies make a last ditch effort to turn a profit. Colorado families need relief from these practices, and they need it now."
