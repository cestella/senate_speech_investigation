When the Social Security system fails Idahoans, their Senator or Congressman often steps in. Such is the case with Jacob Walk of Orofino, who won disability payments after Idaho Senator Mike Crapo took up his case with the federal agency.  Jacob suffers from type-2 neurofibromatosis, a debilitating disease which has caused him considerable difficulties working and walking and has affected his eyesight. Crapo and his staff engaged agency officials and provided detail about Jacob’s condition, including the many tumors growing on nerves within his body. 

But Jacob’s fight is not over. He, his mother Loretta Walk, and other family members know there are many other individuals also having problems receiving assistance and they want to continue to work with Crapo for reforms in such federal programs.  Crapo will meet for the first time with Jacob and his family this week. The Senator will also discuss other federal programs, like the Secure Rural Schools program, and plans for improvements at the Idaho County Airport at Grangeville when he meets with Idaho County Commissioners.
