As Idaho farm producers look to the United States Congress to stop expected tax increases scheduled for the end of this year, the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation announces it has named Idaho Senator Mike Crapo a "Friend of the Farm Bureau." Crapo is a member of the Senate Finance, Budget and Banking Committees, with jurisdiction over tax, funding and lending issues.

Crapo will receive the "Friend of Farm Bureau Award" from Idaho Farm Bureau Executive Vice President and CEO Rick Keller on Thursday, during a ceremony at the Twin Falls County Farm Bureau offices.

Crapo has introduced federal legislation to protect family farms and ranches from the estate tax and to protect Idahoans from the income tax increases set to occur at the end of this calendar year, as tax relief passed in 2001 and 2003 expires. "This is not the time to raise taxes on anyone," Crapo said, "especially the hard-working men and women of American Agriculture."

"Senator Crapo has been a stalwart advocate for agriculture in Washington D.C.," said Idaho Farm Bureau President Frank Priestley. "We appreciate his hard work and understanding of the many complicated issues American agriculture faces. In addition, we especially appreciate the accessibility he provides when we need to meet with him."

Farm Bureau leaders say the most pressing issue in Congress for Americaâ€™s farmers and ranchers is the prompt passage of legislation to provide estate tax relief, keeping capital gains tax rates from increasing and extending other important tax provisions that expired at the end of 2009 or are set to expire at the end of 2010, according to American Farm Bureau President Bob Stallman. "Farm Bureau calls on Congress to act quickly to pass tax legislation when it returns after the election in order to avoid the economic damage that will be caused by tax increases and the uncertainty that surrounds the tax code," Stallman wrote in a letter to members of the House and Senate.
