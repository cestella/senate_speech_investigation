 Idaho Senator Mike Crapo is honoring fourteen inspirational Idahoans this Veterans Day in ceremonies held in Boise, Lewiston, Pocatello, Sandpoint and Twin Falls. This is the ninth year Crapo has honored Idaho veterans and volunteers who work with veterans through the Spirit of Freedom Awards.

“Veterans provide critical service and support to our State and nation that does not end with the conclusion of their military service,” said Crapo. “They exemplify courage and discipline, and their deeds provide encouragement and strengthen resolve in the face of challenge.” 

Spirit of Freedom Awards are presented annually to recipients in two categories – Veterans and Volunteers. Nominations for the awards are made by a number of veterans’ organizations and the commanders of various veterans service organizations. The awardees have demonstrated the spirit, resolve and self-sacrifice integral to our Idaho character.

“I am heartened by the recipients’ benevolence and the steady support they have provided our nation,” Crapo added. “On this Veterans Day, it is a privilege to learn from our veterans and volunteers and pay tribute to their service and sacrifice.”
