Finding creative ways to reduce federal spending and the deficit will be key to the eventual success of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility, according to Commission member and Idaho Senator Mike Crapo. A member of the Senate Budget and Finance Committees, Crapo is one of three Republican Senators serving on the Commission. The Commission’s co-chairs, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, today released their draft recommendations for ideas the Commission membership can take into account. The Commission’s members will now review the first draft proposal and continue to meet and make modifications over the coming weeks, in expectation of a vote on final recommendations by December 1. 

“Getting federal spending and the national debt under control is a key factor for any blueprint for fiscal responsibility,” Crapo said. “The Commission co-chairs are to be commended for putting forward ideas that focus on getting the country back on sound economic footing and reducing our deficits. I look forward now to participating in an aggressive planning process and spirited discussions on how we can further these debt reduction ideas.”
