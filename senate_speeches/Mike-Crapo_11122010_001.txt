Tight budgets won’t stop students in the Notus School District from expanding their literary horizons this year. That’s because the libraries at Notus Junior Senior High School and Notus Elementary School now have more than 150 new books, thanks to the Library of Congress and Idaho Senator Mike Crapo.

Working with the Notus School District, Idaho Senator Mike Crapo and his staff arranged for a delivery of books to the libraries at both schools. Like many other schools in Idaho, economic conditions have limited the number of new books schools can afford. The Library of Congress, in Washington, D.C., works with U.S. Senators and Members of the U.S. House of Representatives to make excess books available for free to qualified recipient school districts.

This week, Crapo’s Regional Director Bryan Ricker and Intern Brian Raybon delivered a dozen boxes of books to the schools. Crapo’s office also provided U.S. flags flown over the U.S. Capitol to help mark the occasion. Superintendant and Principal Benjamin Merrill from Notus Junior Senior High School and Librarians Irene Basaldua and Sharon Villines helped in accepting the books.

Notus Elementary School Principal Tyson Carter said students were excited to receive the books. “The students expressed their sincere gratitude and they were excited to see the boxes of books arrive. This year’s library budget means we’ve been down a few books,” he said.

“Reading expands the imagination and we are proud to partner with the Library of Congress to hopefully make a difference for the students in the Notus School District,” Crapo said.

Both schools received certificates signed by the Senator with the U.S. flags to celebrate the donation. Every year, the Library of Congress donates hundreds of surplus books to educational institutions across the country. Many of those donations are arranged through Members of Congress. 

The Notus students signed handmade cards to the Senator to thank him for his role in the book donation.
