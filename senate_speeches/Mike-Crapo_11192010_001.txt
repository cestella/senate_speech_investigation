 Idaho Senator Mike Crapo has co-sponsored bipartisan legislation regarding the import of collectible and antique firearms into the United States. “The Collectible Firearms Protection Act” would allow the import of curio or relic firearms by a licensed importer without the paperwork required by the U.S. Department of Defense. Crapo joins Senators Jon Tester (D-Montana), Max Baucus (D-Montana), Mark Begich (D-Alaska), Mike Enzi (R-Wyoming), James Inhofe (R-Oklahoma), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Jean Shaheen (D-New Hampshire) and Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi) in co-sponsoring the legislation. The legislation has the support of the National Rifle Association.

“Second Amendment rights clearly apply to Idahoans and all Americans seeking to import antique firearms,” Crapo said. “A recent case involving the proposed sale of surplus rifles from South Korea to qualified U.S. buyers was unnecessarily delayed by federal authorities. This bipartisan bill makes it clear that firearms more than 50 years old and considered antiques or relics can be re-imported and sold to law-abiding Americans.”

Crapo was one of 18 Senators who wrote to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in early October, asking the State Department to reverse the decision to ban the sale of surplus M1 Carbine and Garand rifles from South Korea to qualified buyers in the U.S. The Obama administration initially approved the sale, only to see the State Department block the sale.
