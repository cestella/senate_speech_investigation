WASHINGTON
Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) today applauded grant funding that will support a program for at-risk children whose fathers have been incarcerated or recently released from prison. Funding for Destinationâ€¦Dad, awarded to Christian Heritage of Walton, Neb., by the U.S. Department of Justice, will support families by keeping children in touch with their incarcerated fathers; teaching parenting skills to newly released fathers; and providing encouragement for a crime-free life. Johanns in March wrote a letter to the Justice Department supporting the $300,000 grant for the non-profit organization.

"A caring father and a healthy family can make all the difference in the world to a child," Johanns said. "I support efforts to stabilize and reduce the number of repeat offenders, and I commend Christian Heritage for its commitment to this cause."
