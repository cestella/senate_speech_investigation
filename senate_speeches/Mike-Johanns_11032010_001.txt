WASHINGTON
Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) made the following statement regarding tonight’s election results:

“With the elections over, Congress must quickly refocus on addressing important priorities that were unwisely relegated to the back burner before the election. We have our work cut out for us, from preventing an array of looming tax increases to addressing the deficit.

“In January, with a more balanced Congress, I hope there will be greater cooperation and more willingness to listen to the American people. I would welcome a return to genuine debate, an open amendment process and real solutions.

“When so many Americans believe our country is off course, it is more important than ever to prove we can work together to once again become the shining city on the hill.”
