WASHINGTON
Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) today launched a project to honor Nebraska veterans. Johanns is partnering with the Library of Congress to preserve the oral histories of wartime veterans through the Veterans History Project. He is inviting volunteers to collect, record and forever preserve these personal stories for future generations.

“The Veterans History Project goes beyond what one can learn from a text book by capturing the personal narratives of the brave men and women who fought for our country, often in dangerous territory,” said Johanns. “Nearly 70,000 fascinating firsthand accounts have already been recorded, but there are tens of thousands of Nebraskans whose stories are still untold.”

Johanns’ staff will be training volunteers and providing the guidance necessary to conduct and preserve the interviews with the Library of Congress. Those interested should click here or email Johanns’ office at vets_history@johanns.senate.gov.

In launching the program, Johanns interviewed Nebraska WWII veteran Lt. Col. (ret) Paul Adams of Lincoln. The complete interview is available here.

“Interviewing a decorated Nebraska war hero was a wonderful opportunity to learn more about his experiences overseas and better understand the sacrifices he made,” said Johanns. “It’s gratifying to know Paul’s story of courage and bravery is now preserved for future generations to learn from.”

 BACKGROUND
