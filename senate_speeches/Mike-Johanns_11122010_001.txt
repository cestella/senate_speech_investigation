WASHINGTON
Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) today addressed the moratorium on earmarks proposed by Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC).

“The current earmark process is simply not open, transparent, or merit-based and I intend to support the proposed two-year ban on earmarks for Senate Republicans,” said Johanns. “We must leave no doubt about our commitment to fiscal responsibility, which is why I have never requested earmarks.” The current earmark process contributes to the notion that Members of Congress must focus on ‘bringing home the bacon’ instead of getting our country’s fiscal house in order. I have supported previous proposals to ban earmarks and I will support this one.”
