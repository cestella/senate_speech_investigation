WASHINGTON
Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) today urged his Senate colleagues to stand for small businesses and job creation by fully repealing section 9006 of the health care law, a provision that would create a tsunami of paperwork for small businesses.

“Our first order of business next week ought to be fulfilling the promise to support our job creators by repealing the ludicrous 1099 tax paperwork mandate,” said Johanns.  “I’m pleased the President and members of Congress who opposed my repeal legislation earlier this year now realize the importance of getting rid of this job killing provision.  The bill I have fought to pass since July is in the queue and I welcome this growing bipartisan support.  Millions of employers are watching to see if Washington is finally listening.”

Background:

Section 9006 of the health care law mandates that every business, charity, and local and state government entity submit 1099 forms for business transactions totaling $600 or more in a given year.  This mandate adds routine business expenses like phone bills, office products, shipping costs; and would increase businesses’ reporting requirement by as much as 2,000 percent.

 Johanns introduced legislation on July 14, 2010 and proposed an amendment to the Small Business Jobs Act on September 15, 2010 that would have fully repealed the requirement.
