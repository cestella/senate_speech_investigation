Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) today joined several of his colleagues in supporting a legal brief challenging the individual mandate in the health care law.

“Americans do not want the federal government making their health care decisions,” said Johanns. “Congress’ constitutional power is not limitless, and forcing individuals to purchase government-approved health insurance whether or not they want it is an infringement on their rights. I'm pleased to support this lawsuit challenging the unconstitutional individual mandate.”

 Background:

The amicus brief, expected to be filed later this week, is based on two points:

That the individual mandate in the health care law, which penalizes individuals for not having health insurance, falls outside the Commerce Clause by regulating economic inactivity and forcing individuals into commercial activity.   

Enforcing such a mandate would entail turning the commerce power into an impermissible federal police power, a power traditionally reserved for individual states.

The brief supports the lawsuit filed in Florida on behalf of Nebraska, 20 other states and the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) and individuals.

In December 2009, Johanns supported a motion declaring the individual mandate in the health care bill unconstitutional.

In July 2010, Johanns cosponsored two bills that repeal the individual and employer mandates contained in the new health care law.
