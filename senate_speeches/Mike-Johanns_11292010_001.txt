WASHINGTON
Sen. Johanns (R-Neb) today expressed his disappointment in another failure of the Senate to repeal the 1099 paperwork mandate in the health care law. Johanns has been pushing to eliminate it since July.

“Despite a chorus of discontent about this burdensome provision and overwhelming support from both sides of the aisle to repeal it, the Senate again failed to support our nation’s job creators,” said Johanns. “More than 40 million businesses across the country are now in jeopardy of being hit by this paperwork monsoon. Businesses are already struggling to survive this fragile economy, and failing to repeal the 1099 mandate adds more roadblocks to hiring. The American people have clearly signaled that support for job creation should be a top priority; it’s time for Congress to listen.”

This is the second time the Senate failed to pass legislation offered by Johanns to repeal the 1099 mandate.

Background:

 Johanns’ legislation pays for the repeal using unspent and unobligated accounts to replace the revenue that might have been generated by the 1099 paperwork mandate. The offset represents only about five percent of the total funds in unspent and unobligated accounts and gives the Administration discretion to ensure these funds do not affect ongoing and necessary programs.

 Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT) offered a virtually identical repeal of 1099, instead adding $19 billion to our nation’s deficit and driving up the overall cost of the health care law. The Baucus amendment also failed today.

 Unless repealed, Section 9006 of the health care law will require all businesses, charities, and state and local governments to file 1099 forms every time they purchase $600 or more in goods from another business throughout the year. This new requirement would impact as many as 40 million American businesses.
