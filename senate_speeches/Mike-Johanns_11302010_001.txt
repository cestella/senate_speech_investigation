WASHINGTON
Sen. Johanns (R-Neb) today urged progress during meetings being held between U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk and Korean Minister of Trade Kim Jong-hoon to discuss the U.S.-Korea trade agreement. Johanns noted U.S. exporters paid approximately $1 billion in tariffs in 2009 that would have been eliminated under the agreement, according to experts.

“I'm encouraged by the President’s recent interest in the South Korean free trade agreement, and my hope is that progress will replace promises of doubling exports and talk of enacting the trade agreements,” said Johanns. “Continued delay is frustrating for American industries and South Korea, both of which have been waiting more than three years for us to hold up our end of the bargain. I urge the trade representatives from both countries to take concrete steps towards a final deal.”

The pending trade agreement between the U.S. and South Korea was signed on June 30, 2007, but has never been submitted to Congress for ratification. According to experts, passage of this agreement would create 22,000 to 27,000 U.S. jobs and increase our exports to Korea by $10 billion a year.
