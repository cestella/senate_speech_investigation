Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) applauded the progress announced today by negotiators of the U.S. - South Korea Free Trade Agreement and called on the Obama Administration to promptly complete the agreement and send it to Congress for ratification. Johanns has long-sought to finalize the important agreement with South Korea, the world’s 12th largest economy.

“The time is now, the final terms of this agreement need to be hammered out so it can be finalized,” said Johanns. “I encourage President Obama to quickly finalize and transmit this long-awaited agreement to Congress. The agreement has collected dust for more than three years while European nations have gained a competitive advantage. It is long overdue that Congress has the opportunity to ratify this bi-lateral agreement with our important ally. Our nation’s farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and workers are asking the Administration to replace promises with real action.”
