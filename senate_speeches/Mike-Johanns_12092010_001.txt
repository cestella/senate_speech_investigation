WASHINGTON
With massive tax increases and a deadline to fund essential government services looming, Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) reasserted his pledge to prioritize the two issues most critical to American taxpayers. Johanns voted against legislation unrelated to these priorities after joining his Republican colleagues last week in a commitment to vote against debating any other legislation until bills are brought to the floor to prevent tax increases and operate the federal government.

"The American people are bracing for a historic tax hike in a struggling economy, and it's the Senate's responsibility to alleviate this burden," Johanns said. "We've had twenty-three months to consider this legislation, but instead focused on legislation that expanded the government and bloated the national debt. Bringing these bills to the floor at such a critical time for taxpayers is not a credible attempt to legislate. It is more political gamesmanship. The Senate cannot afford to waste any more time, and I will continue to oppose any other measure until we've voted on these two critical priorities."

Background:

Sen. Johanns voted not to begin debate on the following legislation:

 S. 3991 – Public Safety Employee Cooperation Act

 Would require states and localities to collectively bargain with public safety employees; including firefighters, some police officers, and emergency medical personnel.

 S. 3985 – Emergency Senior Citizen Relief Act

 Would give a $250 bonus payment to seniors, adding about $14 billion to the national debt.

 S. 847 – 9/11 Health and Compensation Act

 Would create a $7.4 billion entitlement and would re-open the 9/11 victims compensation fund.

 Includes a tax increase that would override longstanding tax treaties; could damage relations with major trading partners; discourage foreign investment in the U.S.; and could prompt retaliation by foreign governments against U.S. companies competing abroad.
