WASHINGTON
Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) today voted to ensure taxes for every American will not increase beginning January 1. The Tax Relief Act also would implement a payroll tax cut, extend ethanol and biodiesel tax credits, and continue unemployment benefits through December 2011. Today's vote was to invoke cloture, or end debate, on the bill, which required 60 votes. A final vote, expected tomorrow, would require only a simple majority vote.

 

"I believe this proposal is necessary to prevent the largest tax hike in American history," Johanns said. "The American people are asking Congress to ensure their taxes don't go up in a struggling economy. It is my hope that the Senate builds on this compromise into 2011 to continue charting a positive economic course for our country."
