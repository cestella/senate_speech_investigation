WASHINGTON
Sen. Johanns (R-Neb.) today applauded the Senate’s passage of a bill he introduced with Democrat Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ) to improve the housing voucher system for persons with disabilities and mental illnesses. Streamlining this system will increase the availability of affordable housing and will make the construction process more efficient.

“Reasonably priced housing is a critical piece of the puzzle for disabled persons seeking to become independent,” said Johanns. “This bill will streamline efforts to provide them adequate and affordable homes and ensure no one slips through the cracks. I’m pleased my colleagues agreed that this bill is the right direction to provide stability for these vulnerable citizens.”

The Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act would reform the Section 811 housing program by ensuring that people with disabilities have affordable homes. Currently, virtually no new homes are being built because of inefficiencies and an inability to combine various sources of funding. The bill enjoys strong support from housing and disability advocacy programs and passed unanimously in the Senate.
