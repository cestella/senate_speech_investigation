WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) today voted against the DREAM Act and a bill to repeal the military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy. The DREAM Act cloture vote failed by a vote of 55-41, and the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" moved forward, 63-33. Both required 60 votes. Final passage on the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" is expected later today.

"I am not unsympathetic to the plight of children in this country illegally who are facing difficult circumstances," Johanns said. "Yet offering citizenship to illegal immigrants would not be just while so many are waiting to enter the country legally and also desire an American education for their children.

"I oppose the repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' because of the undue burden it would bring upon our military. I do not believe imposing this new regime on our military in the middle of a war is the right thing to do.

"The Majority Leader has had 24 months to bring these bills to a vote and now in the 11th hour of this lame duck Congress is trying to cram through the remains of their repudiated agenda. The American people clearly demonstrated in November's election that they want a different direction for this country, and I am disappointed that these bills have diverted our attention from bolstering our economy and controlling our runaway national debt."
