WASHINGTON -Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) today authored a letter, signed by 11 of his colleagues to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, urging him to follow through on his statements regarding a cost-benefit analysis to be conducted on changes to livestock marketing regulations proposed by the Grain Inspection Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA). Secretary Vilsack pledged in a meeting with meat industry officials last week that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) would conduct "a far more rigorous cost-benefit analysis." Johanns' letter strongly endorses a new analysis.

"To date, USDA has not conducted a reliable cost-benefit analysis on these proposed changes, which many believe will lead to decreased competition and fewer livestock marketing opportunities," Johanns said. "Producers, meatpackers, and consumers in Nebraska and across the country deserve a clear analysis from the Office of the Chief Economist at USDA about changes to a program that will affect how they conduct daily business. I was pleased to hear the Secretary discuss this idea; now it's time to put it into practice."

Background:

	A copy of the letter can be found below.

	An economic analysis commissioned by meat industry groups and conducted by Informa Economics Inc. estimated that the rule would result in job losses of more than 22,800, an annual decrease in gross domestic product of as much as $1.56 billion, and an annual loss in tax revenues of $359 million.

	USDA has yet to conduct a similar analysis.

	Sec. Vilsack made his comments in a December 13 meeting and conference call discussing the next steps in reviewing the GIPSA rule.

	The proposed rule would amend regulations of the Packers and Stockyard Act.
