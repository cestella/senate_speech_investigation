WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) today applauded the U.S. House of Representative’s passage of a bill he introduced with Democrat Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) to improve the housing voucher system for persons with disabilities and mental illness. Streamlining this system will increase the availability of affordable housing and will make the construction process more efficient.

“Reasonably priced housing is a critical piece of the puzzle for courageous people who are overcoming disabilities and seeking to become independent,” said Johanns. “This bill will streamline efforts to provide them adequate and affordable homes and ensure no one slips through the cracks. I’m pleased my colleagues agreed that this bill is the right direction to provide stability for these vulnerable citizens.”

The Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act reforms the Section 811 housing program by ensuring that people with disabilities have affordable homes. Currently, virtually no new homes are being built because of inefficiencies and an inability to combine various sources of funding. The bill also passed unanimously in the Senate on December 17. The legislation now heads to President Obama for his signature.
