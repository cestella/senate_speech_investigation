WASHINGTON - Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) today voted against ending debate on the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) in the Senate. Johanns is seeking full debate on the six amendments currently pending that would address significant concerns raised about the agreement.

"After much consideration about this important treaty, I have determined that it's just this simple, we should stay here as long as it takes to get this right," said Johanns. "Especially when matters of national security are at stake, the consequences of a treaty can be profound and serious. Having helped to negotiate international agreements as Secretary of Agriculture, I have learned that every word matters. With important amendments yet to even be considered or debated, I cannot vote to support cutting off debate."

The cloture vote was agreed to by a vote of 67-28.
