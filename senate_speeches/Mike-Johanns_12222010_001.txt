WASHINGTON – Sen. Mike Johanns (R-Neb.) today voted for a revised version of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act to build on medical monitoring and treatment programs for 9/11 first responders who were exposed to toxins at Ground Zero. The bill also provides compensation and offers liability protections to contractors who assisted with the response.

“I’m pleased that changes made to this legislation allowed for broad support in the Senate, sending an important message to America’s heroes,” said Johanns. “No amount of money can take away the suffering endured by the brave men and women who answered the call for help, but financial strain should not be among the challenges they face in the future. It is also important to support contractors who stepped up in the aftermath of 9/11 by protecting them from lawsuits related to their patriotism. We must leave no doubt about our country’s commitment to those who helped America regain her footing on one of the darkest days in our history.”
