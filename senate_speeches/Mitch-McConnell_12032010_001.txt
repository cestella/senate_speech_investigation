Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell delivered the following statement Friday regarding the Deficit Commission report:

"I would like to thank Erskine Bowles, Sen. Alan Simpson and the entire commission for guiding a serious effort to address our country's most serious fiscal challenge. Although I may not agree with all of the Commission's recommendations, there will be no comfortable solutions to digging America out of a $14 trillion debt and I appreciate the bold attempt to provide a pathway back to a sustainable economic future for our country. Historically, divided government has provided great opportunity to tackle the country's biggest problems on a truly bipartisan basis and it is my hope that this effort will serve as a catalyst for achieving the spending and entitlement reform that our country so desperately needs.”
