Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell delivered the following remarks on the Senate floor Saturday after the Senate’s bipartisan rejection of two Democrat-sponsored tax hike proposals:

“According to the strange logic of Democrat leaders in Congress, the best way to show middle-class Americans that they care about creating jobs is to slam some of America's top job creators with a massive tax hike.

“Today's votes were an affront to the millions of Americans who are struggling to find work and a clear signal that Democrats in Congress still haven't gotten the message of the November elections.

“With unemployment over 9 percent for more consecutive months than at any other time since World War II, the voters are looking for a different approach in Washington.

“Two years of out-of-control spending and big-government policies have led to record deficits and debt, chronic unemployment, and deep uncertainty about our nation's fiscal future. Meaningless show-votes and anti-business rhetoric won't do anything to make the situation better.

“This Saturday session is a total waste of the American people’s time. One of the votes we held today was opposed by every single Republican and many Democrats.  And the other vote we held was a poll tested plan opposed by every single Republican and the President of the United States. And as you can see, nothing we did today stopped the tax hikes that are now less than one month away. As The Majority Leader said this morning, ‘these theatrics need to end.’

“There is strong bipartisan opposition to these attempts to raise taxes on small businesses across the country. Americans don't want political posturing; they want jobs. Today's' votes were the clearest signal yet that Democrats in Congress do not take our nation's jobs crisis seriously.”
