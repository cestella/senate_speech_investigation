Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell released the following statement Wednesday regarding the vote on the bipartisan tax compromise:

“The vote today showed the broad bipartisan support for protecting families and small businesses from a job-killing tax hike and represents a clear shift in the debate over America’s path to economic recovery. Democrats joined our effort to ensure taxes aren't going up on anyone and that Americans are keeping their money so they, not the government are more equipped to help bring our economy back. Now it’s up to our colleagues in the House and we urge Democrat Leaders to resist playing political games and making partisan changes so that American taxpayers won’t be hit with a huge, job-killing tax hike on January 1st.”
