Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell delivered the following remarks Thursday, December 16, 2010 to thank the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces for their service:

“Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the members of America's Armed Forces who are deployed during this Christmas season. The sacrifices of our military and those of their families are always great, but especially so during wartime and the holidays. As most Americans celebrate this time of joy and good cheer it is important that we take a moment to honor and remember the brave men and women in uniform who are defending our well being overseas and to thank their families as well.

“Kentucky's military installations have been in the thick of the fight in the war on terror. The 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, for example, is once again overseas. The unit is fully deployed and is executing a critical mission in Afghanistan.

“The Army's 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division is currently deploying from Fort Knox to Afghanistan. The Duke Brigade, as it is known, is the first unit of its kind at Fort Knox since the 1990s.

“And the Kentucky National Guard continues to deploy to theater. Just last week, members of the 123rd Civil Engineer Squadron left for Southwest Asia.

“I am profoundly grateful for the sacrifice of our servicemembers and military families. And, as a Kentuckian, I swell with pride at the contributions made by units from the Commonwealth's military installations and by Kentucky servicemembers. During this holiday season our prayers are with them.”
