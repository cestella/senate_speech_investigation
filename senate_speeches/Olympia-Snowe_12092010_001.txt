WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) released the following statement:

“My vote today against cloture was on the basis that the Majority prohibited any amendments from being offered to the $725 billion Defense Authorization bill.  It did not relate to the provision incorporated in the underlying legislation to repeal the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy, as I was still in the process of reviewing the Department of Defense’s comprehensive report released just last week and subsequent testimony of Defense Secretary Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Mullen and the five service chiefs.  In denying our ability to offer any amendments to this critical authorization bill, which for a half century has traditionally been considered much earlier in the year and on a bipartisan basis, the Majority has continued to engage in the same, status quo politics that the voters overwhelmingly and resoundingly rejected at the polls just one month ago.  The 17-year-old Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy should have been considered apart from the comprehensive Defense Authorization bill, respecting the sensitive nature of the issue and providing ample time for floor debate.  Unfortunately, these shenanigans have short-circuited consideration of this repeal and any opportunity to move forward with this discussion has been undermined by the Majority’s desire to score political points in the remaining days of this legislative year.”
