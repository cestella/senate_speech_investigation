WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins (R-Maine) today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has designated Hancock and Penobscot Counties as Secretarial disaster areas to assist in the mitigation of losses caused by drought that occurred from May 11 through October 21, 2010. 

“This designation will provide direct assistance to struggling farmers during this difficult season,” said Senators Snowe and Collins.  “The availability of Farm Service Agency (FSA) emergency loans and Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments (SURE) payments are welcome relief that will support Maine’s farmers as they prepare for the upcoming 2011 growing season.”

Farmers in eligible counties have eight months from today to apply for emergency loan assistance.  FSA will consider each emergency loan application on its own merits, taking into account the extent of production losses, security available, and repayment ability. SURE Program applications for 2010 crop losses will be accepted in 2011, when the 2010 farm revenue data required by statute becomes available. Those affected are encouraged to contact the FSA directly at:

Maine State Farm Service Agency
967 Illinois Avenue
Bangor, ME 04401
Telephone: 207.990.9100 ext.2

Penobscot County Farm Service Agency
1423 Broadway
Bangor, ME 04401
Telephone: 207.947.3555 ext. 2

Additionally, in accordance with section 321(a) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, Aroostook, Knox, Piscataquis, Somerset, Waldo, and Washington Counties are named as contiguous disaster counties, and may also be eligible for FSA assistance.
