U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) announced today that he has joined an effort by Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) to make a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution a top priority of the Senate Republican Conference. The resolution will be voted on next week. 

“It’s well past time that we get our budget back into balance – if Utah families can live within their means then so should the federal government,” said Hatch. “I’ve long fought for a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, and reintroduced legislation earlier this year doing just that. I’m glad that Mike Lee is a strong supporter of this effort and am grateful to have such an able partner to get our nation’s out-of-control fiscal situation back under control.” 

Joining Hatch and Cornyn on the resolution are Senators Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina), Jim Inhofe (R-Oklahoma), Mike Enzi (R-Wyoming), Jeff Sessions (R-Alabama), David Vitter (R-Louisiana), John Ensign (R-Nevada), and John Thune (R-South Dakota), and Senators-elect Mike Lee (R-Utah), Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), Kelly Ayotte (R-New Hampshire), and Pat Toomey (R-Pennsylvania). 

Earlier this year, Hatch introduced a Balanced Budget Amendment that would: 

	Require Congress to submit a budget every year in which expenditures do not exceed revenues unless 3/5ths of each house of Congress approves a non-balanced budget; 
	Direct the Treasury Department to use surpluses to pay down the nation’s debt; 
	Require all tax increases to be approved by 2/3rds of the members of Congress; and 
	Allow Congress to waive the balanced budget requirement during years when a declaration of war is in effect.
