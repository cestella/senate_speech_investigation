U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) will support a moratorium on congressional earmarks that will be considered tomorrow in a meeting of the Senate Republican Conference: 

“Earmarks have come to represent the out-of-control federal spending the American people are fed up with. They want change from Washington. They want to know that their elected officials are focused on those priorities that are essential to moving our country forward. With that firmly in mind, I voted twice this year for a full earmark moratorium. I will do the same again tomorrow. 

“We now need to move ahead with real pro-growth strategies to get our economy moving again like stopping one of the largest tax hikes in history, bringing federal spending down, and getting our $13 trillion debt under control. Those are the issues we need to focus on to get our country back on track and to ensure Utah families face a brighter, more prosperous future. 

“To the people of Utah, I have always said I have an obligation as your Senator to make sure our state, our communities and our people get back the hard-earned tax dollars we contribute to the federal treasury. That’s only fair and right, and is something I will not stop fighting for. Ultimately, Utah taxpayers shouldn’t be footing the bill for other states.”
