U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued the following statement on the verdict in the Ghailani case in New York: 

“The Obama Administration rolled the dice in a time of war by insisting on a civilian trial for Ahmed Ghailani for conspiracy and murder in the 1998 terrorist bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 

“Yesterday’s verdict in New York demonstrates the dangers of forcing terrorism trials into civilian courts. Last November, Attorney General Holder told the Senate Judiciary Committee that failure is not an option when it comes to trying terrorists in federal criminal court. The reality is that of the 285 charges against him, Ghailani was convicted on only one count, leaving open the very real possibility that this terrorist could be released. 

“Federal criminal courts are not suited for terror trials. Military commissions are the most appropriate venue for these trials and are conducted in a manner that provide Constitutional protections to the defendant, while protecting classified information. 

“It’s time for the Administration to listen to the 9/11 families and the American people and change course by putting all terror trials through our military commission system.”
