U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch, the incoming Ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, issued the following statement after Congressional Democrats announced yesterday that they have planned a series of politically-motivated votes on the tax relief that is set to expire on January 1st for middle-class families, job creators and investors: 

“Enough is enough. Congressional Democrats’ decision to move forward with a series of politically-motivated votes on taxes is no comfort to the millions of American small businesses, investors and middle-class families, who can’t afford to see their taxes go up on January 1st. If Democrats’ have their way, small business’ marginal tax rates could go up between 17 to 24 percent. 

“The American people sent a clear message on November 2nd that they want Washington to focus on getting our economy moving. With our unemployment rate stuck at 9.6 percent, who can blame them. But instead of demonstrating a sincere willingness to listen, Washington Democrats have decided to play political games. 

“I’ve repeatedly said that while I’d prefer to make all the tax levels that have been on the books for the past ten years permanent, we should consider an extension of all the rates at least through the next presidential election. We need to stop the tax increase on both small businesses who employ around 70 percent of our workforce and middle class families. That not just what Republicans want, but also what the people of our country are demanding. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have had four years to stop these looming tax increases – now’s the time for them to act responsibly, stop the games and extend all the current tax relief for middle-class families and small businesses alike.
