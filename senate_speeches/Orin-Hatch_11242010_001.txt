Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, today lauded the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) for its decision to outlaw the possession and sale of “Spice,” “K2” and other popular synthetic marijuana products for a year while it weighs the merits of a permanent ban. 

“With impressionable teens and young adults in Utah and across the nation abusing marijuana substitutes to get high, the DEA’s decision to criminalize the possession and sale of these drugs and the chemicals they contain is the right prescription to help law enforcement professionals head off this fast-growing epidemic,” said Hatch, who asked DEA Acting Administrator Michelle Leonhart by letter earlier this month to make synthetic marijuana a controlled substance. 

More than two dozen states and scores of counties have already passed legislation classifying Spice, which contains chemicals that mimic THC and has been linked to 24 deaths in the U.S., as a controlled substance. Several Utah cities – Provo, Layton and Ogden, just to name a few – have also banned marijuana alternatives. 

Within 30 days, the DEA will make “fake pot” products illegal nationwide to allow time for the Department of Health and Human Services time to study whether or not the chemicals in the synthetic drugs should be regulated as a controlled substance permanently. 

A copy of Hatch’s letter to Leonhart, which helped prompt the DEA’s decision, follows: 


November 8, 2010 

The Honorable Michele Leonhart 
Drug Enforcement Administration 
U.S. Department of Justice 
700 Army-Navy Drive

Dear Administrator Leonhart, 

I am concerned about the growing use of the street drug known as Spice. Spice is a cannabinoid which mimics the effects of THC. As you know, Spice is fast becoming an alternative to marijuana. It produces effects similar to marijuana and appears to be commercially available at convenience stores and paraphernalia retailers commonly referred to as “head shops.” 

In March 2009, the Drug Enforcement Administration issued an intelligence alert to law enforcement that Spice was becoming a drug and chemical of concern. At this time, Spice is currently not controlled by the Drug Enforcement Administration. Young adults and adolescents are turning to Spice as a form of legalized marijuana. I am sad to report that this trend is growing to epidemic proportions in my home state of Utah. I have received numerous letters from constituents and had discussions with Utah law enforcement officials expressing the need for an administrative and legislative remedy to the Spice problem. 

Currently, almost two dozen states have passed legislation identifying spice as a controlled substance. I am requesting your assistance in having the Drug Enforcement Administration exercise its emergency scheduling authority to classify Spice as a schedule I substance. Spice has a current pattern of abuse as a form of legalized marijuana that is being openly sold by retailers. Since your agency went so far as to issue a previous intelligence alert on this substance 19 months ago, the scope, duration and significance of Spice abuse was alarming to the Drug Enforcement Administration back then. Spice abuse and distribution continues to escalate. I firmly believe that Spice poses a risk to public health. A recent study by the Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology determined that Spice has similar negative health effects as cannabis consumption. 

If Spice were considered a schedule I substance, this would assist law enforcement in addressing this growing problem. Additionally, I am aware that the Drug Enforcement Administration and participating Utah law enforcement agencies in the Rocky Mountain HIDTA are working together to formulate an action plan to address Spice abuse in Utah. I believe that an emergency scheduling would be a great help in addressing and suppressing what is essentially legalized marijuana distribution. 

Thank you for your consideration in these matters.
