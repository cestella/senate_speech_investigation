WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS), a former Marine, today released the following statement in recognition of Veteran’s Day:

“On this Veterans Day, I join my fellow American citizens in saluting our nation's heroes. Their service in the defense of this great nation deserves our respect and gratitude - particularly for those who made the ultimate sacrifice. This day of annual homage allows us to honor their contributions.

“Kansans have a long tradition of supporting and honoring our veterans. Two examples come to mind. Recently, I had the privilege to meet Sentinel Kyle Obrosky, a Topeka native, who participates in the sacred practice of standing guard over the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery. These soldiers are the best of the U.S. Army and keep watch over the Tomb 24 hours a day, seven days a week, on holidays and in all weather.. His own words describing the importance of his solemn duty also applies to all veterans and why we pause to honor those who have served: ‘They are known but to God. We are their friends and family now, it is up to me to take care and honor them. They did not lose their country.’

“There is no better example of this statement than the steady pilgrimage of Honor Flights to visit the National WWII Memorial. Championed by our own Senator Bob Dole, volunteers including high school students, coordinate to bring WWII vets to visit their monument. Without the contributions of this Greatest Generation, American would not be what it is today.

“Each individual veteran and service member's story of sacrifice is unique, but all have the collective threads of honor and service which makes our great nation the symbol of freedom and liberty around the world. From this Marine, on Veterans Day to all those that have served our country, Semper Fi.”
