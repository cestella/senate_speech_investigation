WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Pat Roberts today released the following statement on media reports of a framework reached to extend critical tax relief for all Americans for two years:

 “I am encouraged that Republicans and the President were able to come to an agreement on a plan to protect all Americans from the disastrous consequences of raising taxes on a nation recovering from a recession. This framework extends tax relief for two years and will allow businesses of all sizes to plan and create jobs and will bring real relief to all families struggling to make ends meet.

 “I hope the Congress will adopt this language and send a bill to the President’s desk before the end of the month.”

 Senator Roberts is a member of the Senate Committee on Finance.
