(MONDAY, Jan. 3) Vermont’s Congressional Delegation – Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Congressman Peter Welch (D-Vt.) – this week announced the nominations of 29 Vermont high school students for appointments to the U.S. Service Academies.  Vermonters nominated by members of the Delegation include applicants to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.  Congressional nominations are required for applications to the prestigious academy programs.  Students offered appointments will receive full scholarships and can graduate as commissioned officers in the military. 

Leahy, Sanders and Welch recognized the young Vermonters in a reception with the nominees and their families that the Delegation hosted on Sunday at the Statehouse in Montpelier. 

Leahy said, “The challenges we face as a nation today require leadership based on integrity, quality education, critical thinking and decision making skills.  In carrying on our state’s long tradition of service to community and country, these young Vermonters are the best of the best.  Their willingness to serve and develop their full leadership potential is a testament to their families and friends, their schools and our state.”

Sanders said, “I am proud of the Vermonters nominated to the service academies, and they should be proud of their academic accomplishments and commitment to public service.  I am confident that those students who are accepted at the academies and go on to serve their country will be outstanding representatives of Vermont.”

Welch said, "At a young age, these Vermonters have shown a remarkable commitment to their state and country. Their hard work, dedication and leadership potential speaks volumes about them as individuals and their future. As they join the generations of Vermonters that have made our state and nation proud, I commend their desire to serve and wish them the best.”

Nominees will be notified by the Academies whether they will be offered appointments in early 2011.  Vermonters interested in obtaining service academy nominations can contact Leahy’s office at (802) 229-0569, Sanders’ office at           (802) 862-0697, or Welch’s office at (802) 652-2450.
