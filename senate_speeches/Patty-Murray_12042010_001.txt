(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) released the following statement after Senate Republicans voted to block providing tax cuts to all but the very wealthiest Americans. In back-to-back votes, Republicans voted against tax cuts for families and small businesses, extending unemployment insurance for workers hurt by the recession, and providing tax fairness for Washington families by extending the state sales tax deduction. 

“Today Senate Republicans showed their true colors. After a campaign year filled with promises of debt reduction, cutting taxes, and helping small businesses, when Republicans were given the chance to do all three at once, they said no. Instead, they decided to put millionaires before the middle class.

“Middle class Washington families and small businesses have been squeezed by this recession and we need to do everything possible to get them the tax relief they need. I’m extremely disappointed that Republicans are holding the support they need hostage in order to give costly tax cuts to millionaires that don’t create jobs.

“Getting our country back on its feet is going to take shared sacrifice, smart investments, and tough but necessary budget cuts.  Today Republicans wasted a golden opportunity to make real progress by drawing a line in the sand on behalf of the very wealthiest Americans.

“They also wasted an opportunity to extend the state sales tax deduction that so many Washington state families rely on to put money back in their pocket, and to provide unemployment benefits to thousands of Washington state workers who have lost their jobs in this recession and are struggling to put food on the table this holiday season.

“Middle class families can’t afford for the help they need to be held hostage and we cannot afford to continue wasting opportunities to take meaningful action to reduce our debt."
