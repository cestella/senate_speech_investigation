(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) applauded the Senate passage of the Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010, which reverses the scheduled 25% cut in Medicare and Tricare reimbursement rates and extends the current doctor payment rates through 2011.

“Seniors and doctors in Washington state and across the country deserve the health care certainty that this bill will bring them,” said Senator Patty Murray. “While I will continue to work toward a long-term reimbursement solution that works for Washington state’s seniors and is fair for Washington state’s doctors, this is a strong step in the right direction.”

In addition to extending the current reimbursement rates, the bill also includes extensions of other expiring health care provisions, including protections for rural hospitals and doctors, Transitional Medical Assistance and the Special Diabetes Program. 

The legislation would be paid for by modifying the policy regarding overpayments of the health care affordability tax credit.  This policy does not change the tax credits for which people are eligible based on their income.  Instead, the proposal would change the way people pay back overpayments when they have received more credit than they are eligible for because, for example, they earned more money than expected in a given year.

The legislation must now be passed by the House and signed into law by the President
