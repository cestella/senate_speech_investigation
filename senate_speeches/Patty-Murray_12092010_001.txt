(Washington, D.C.) – Today, the National Defense Authorization Act containing the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was blocked by Senate Republicans. U.S Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) voted for the bill, but it failed 57-40.  The legislation required sixty votes to proceed.

Senator Murray released the following statement after the vote:

“It is truly shameful that Senate Republicans continue to block the repeal of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.’ This policy has failed in its intended goals, done a tremendous disservice to men and women who want nothing more than to defend their country and the freedoms America stands for—and it’s time for it to go. I am going to keep working to repeal ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’ and I urge Senate Republicans to end their obstruction and allow this bill to pass.”
