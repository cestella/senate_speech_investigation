(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) announced that the Navy will be stationing the USS Nimitz at Naval Station Everett following the departure of the USS Abraham Lincoln.

Murray received a call from Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus informing her of the decision.

“This is great news for the Everett community and the United States Navy,” said Senator Patty Murray. “I have been working closely with the Navy to make sure they understand the advantages of stationing a new carrier in this community.
