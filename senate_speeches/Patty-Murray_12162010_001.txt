(Washington, D.C.) –U.S. Senator Patty Murray released the following statement after Senate Republicans blocked consideration of the Omnibus Appropriations bill. 

“By blocking the bills that fund the federal government, Senate Republicans have once again put politics before people. By rejecting compromise, favoring filibuster, and running out the clock out on the American people, Republicans have stalled a budget that invests in the critical needs of middle class families and our economy. Unfortunately, their actions have very real consequences. 

“Because Republicans have played games with this budget, somebody loses. And in this case it’s the needs of the most vulnerable in Washington state. Refusing to pass these bills means that education for children, housing assistance for homeless veterans, loans for disadvantaged students, and badly needed investments for senior citizens, have all been put at risk. And importantly, at a time when we can least afford it, this action threatens job creation in communities all throughout the country. 

“At kitchen tables all across my home state, families that are struggling to get by are making the tough decisions about their budgets and their future. They deserve the same from the people they elected to fight for their priorities. Republicans have shown that they would rather put off what we can do today, for next Congress, or for the next time it’s politically convenient. Unfortunately, struggling families don’t have the luxury of waiting for the help this bill provides. 

“It’s time for Republicans to step up to join us in the job of governing. Every day they choose to sit on the sidelines is another day our country suffers.”
