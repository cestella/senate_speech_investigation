(Washington, D.C.) – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) applauded the passage of a bill that will strengthen and expand science and mathematics programs in schools in Washington state and across the country. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 includes provisions to expand science and mathematics programs at all points in our education system. Additionally, the Act directs business and the federal government to coordinate with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education programs to help create innovative educational opportunities, increase research investment, and improve economic competitiveness.

“Thanks to ground-breaking educational programs, Washington state is home to some of the world’s most innovative workers, businesses, and schools. However, we must continue developing new programs and applying more resources if we want our workers to be competitive in the global economy,” said Senator Murray. “This bill will help America’s workers continue to compete, and will direct the government to use available tools to strengthen educational opportunities and increase investments in research projects that will benefit future generations.”

The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 will:

Increase research investment;
Strengthen educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics from elementary through graduate school; and
Develop an infrastructure that will enhance innovation and competitiveness in the United States
