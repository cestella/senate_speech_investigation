U.S. Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) today voted against a cloture motion for S. 3816, the Reid-Durbin legislation to implement a new international tax regime and punish American companies with punitive tax increases. The motion was rejected on a bipartisan basis.

“Once again, the Majority Leader denied Republicans the ability to offer any amendments and improve this bill,” Sen. Burr said. “I cannot support legislation that will place American jobs at risk. This bill would hurt the ability of American companies to compete in a global marketplace, costing us jobs right here at home.”

S. 3816 would have raised tax burdens on imports from U.S.-owned corporations with no change in the treatment of imports from foreign-owned corporations. This would force consumers to pay more for American products, leading to potential job losses in the United States.
