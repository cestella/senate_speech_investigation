U.S. Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) today issued the following statement on his vote against the Continuing Resolution (H.R. 3081) which, when scored on a full-year basis, would cost $1.25 trillion: 

 â€œGovernment spending has exploded the last two years, posing a grave threat to future generations of Americans who will be forced to foot the bill.  We must make tough decisions, and we should start by cutting federal spending to 2008 levels now.  Unfortunately, this continuing resolution is just continuing the reckless spending policies of the last two years."  

During consideration of this bill, Senator Burr supported amendments to make it more fiscally responsible.  One was an amendment offered by Senator DeMint (R-SC) that would allow this bill to continue funding the government until February 4, 2011.  This would prevent retiring and defeated Senators from voting on spending bills during a lame-duck session of Congress. 
 
Another amendment, offered by Senator Thune (R-SD), would reduce by 5% spending on all items except defense, national security, veterans funding, and programs specified to receive altered levels of funding through the bill, such as the 2010 census.  This amendment would have reduced government spending by over $22 billion.  Both of these amendments were defeated.
