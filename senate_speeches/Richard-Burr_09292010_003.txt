U.S. Senator Richard Burr (R-NC) today celebrated passage of legislation marking December 18, 2010 as “Gold Star Wives Day.”  This day provides an opportunity to honor the members of Gold Star Wives of America, a volunteer organization that has assisted widows and survivors of fallen military members since it was founded in 1945, and thank them for their untiring efforts and support. 

“The qualities of Gold Star Wives – their strength, selflessness and kindness towards others – reflect those of one of the organization’s founders, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.” Burr said.  “Out of love and duty to their country, members of Gold Star Wives have volunteered to take on responsibilities that consume significant amounts of time and energy. By marking this day, we can offer a small token of appreciation for their patriotism and sacrifice.”
