President Obama yesterday signed the Veterans’ Benefits Act of 2010 into law.  This new law contains several provisions authored by Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC).  Sen. Burr welcomed the bill’s passage into law with the following statement:
 
“This new law helps address the needs of veterans who sustained injuries while serving our nation, including wounds suffered as a result of the ever-changing nature of modern warfare. Veterans with severe traumatic brain injuries and those who have suffered from a loss of limb may now receive greater benefits that can help them live more independently in their own homes and communities and help give them a better quality of life,” said Sen. Burr. “It is our duty to ensure that severely-wounded veterans are given every opportunity to live full and productive lives. There is always more we can do for our country’s injured heroes, but this new law is a step in the right direction.”
 
Portions of the new law that were sponsored by Sen. Burr include one that provides the highest level of "aid and attendance" benefits for veterans with severe traumatic brain injuries; a second that will reduce the delay severely-injured servicemembers may face in receiving VA benefits as they transition from military to civilian life; and a provision to enhance disability compensation for certain disabled veterans with difficulties using prostheses.  The Veterans’ Benefits Act of 2010 also improves life insurance benefits for veterans, enhances veterans’ burial benefits, increases severely disabled veterans’ access to automobiles or other transportation that can accommodate their disabilities, and strengthens protections under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.
