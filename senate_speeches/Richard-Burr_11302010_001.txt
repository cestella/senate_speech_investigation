Today, Senator Burr issued the following statement on S. 510, the Food Safety Modernization Act:
 
“Our nation’s food safety system was designed over a century ago and was appropriate for a world in which most of our food was grown and processed domestically.  I voted in support of S. 510 today because I believe it is important that we modernize and update our approach to food safety to address issues that stem from our increasingly global food supply. After months of discussion and debate, I am confident the final version will work for North Carolina and will protect small processors and farms.
