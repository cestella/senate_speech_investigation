Today I opposed legislation to repeal the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. I opposed the bill because I am concerned about the impact of lifting “don’t ask, “don’t tell” on unit cohesion and combat effectiveness, particularly at a time when so many U.S. military personnel are engaged in combat-intensive missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 
            The “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy continues to be the subject of contentious debate within the military and among military families whose sons and daughters serve in the Armed Forces. The opposition of the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General James Amos, as well as other active and retired military personnel, underscores these concerns.
