U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar was notified today that the Veedersburg-Van Buren Fire Department in Fountain County will receive a grant totaling $36,518 for operations and safety. The grants are through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program.
 
“First responders are the backbone of our communities and it is vital to ensure they have the proper equipment and training,” Lugar said.
 
In Fiscal Year 2010, AFG was administered by FEMA’s Grant Programs Directorate in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration. The AFG program provides grants on a competitive basis to rural, urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States.
