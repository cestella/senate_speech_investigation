U.S. Senator Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) today made the following statement in response to the U.S. Navy’s decision to proceed with a dual procurement for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) by awarding the LCS contract to both Austal USA and Lockheed Martin.

The contract will allow Austal USA, which is located in Mobile, Alabama, to produce 10 ships for the Navy. This will mean that close to 2,000 jobs will be added in south Alabama to work on this program.

“The Littoral Combat Ship award is extremely important to our Navy and will provide a new capability to face the asymmetric threats of the future. 

“The LCS program is greatly needed for the Navy to operate in shallow waters to combat the threats of surface craft, submarines, and mines.  Austal’s LCS trimaran is fast and maneuverable and the right ship to meet our military’s missions. This ship offers the greatest fuel efficiency and best combat capability for our warfighters. 

"I remain concerned, however, about this new Navy acquisition strategy, how Secretary Mabus reached this decision, and the additional costs this will add to the program.  I look forward to learning more about this decision in the coming days.”
