U.S. Senator Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) today made the following statement after the Senate failed to extend tax relief to all American taxpayers.

“President Obama’s policies have generated massive debt and bureaucracy but not jobs, as evidenced by yesterday's increase in the unemployment rate.  The Democrats have created the most anti-business environment our country has ever seen.  Now they want to take money from job creators to subsidize this job-killing agenda. 

"We must instead pursue pro-growth policies and establish the conditions for job creation.  First and foremost, we must not raise taxes.  I oppose increasing taxes on anyone, especially during difficult economic times like these."
