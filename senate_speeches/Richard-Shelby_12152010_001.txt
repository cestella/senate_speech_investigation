U.S. Senator Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), today voted in favor of legislation that ensures taxes on American individuals and businesses will not increase at the beginning of next year.  The legislation passed by a vote of 81-19.  Following his vote, Shelby released the following statement:

“We must create the conditions necessary for businesses to thrive and our economy to grow, and we must do so immediately.  The last thing businesses need is higher taxes and more uncertainty as they plan for the coming year.  This legislation ensures Americans’ taxes will not go up on January 1st.  Raising taxes on individuals and businesses is the wrong move period, but especially during difficult economic times such as these.”
