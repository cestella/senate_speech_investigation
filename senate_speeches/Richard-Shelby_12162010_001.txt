Today, U.S. Senators Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) and Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) met with Mr. Kenneth Feinberg, the government-appointed administrator of the Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF), regarding the oil claims process progress in Alabama. After the meeting, Shelby released the following statement:

“After meeting with Mr. Feinberg in November and asking him to return to Alabama to address outstanding claims, he returned to my office today.  Mr. Feinberg agreed to post on the GCCF website details and explanations on how claims are processed.  Further, Mr. Feinberg promised that on Monday, December 20, all interim or final payments will be issued to claimants and previously denied claims can be re-filed.  I was assured by Mr. Feinberg that there is no longer a backlog of claims that were already submitted to BP.

“I believe that Alabamians must be treated justly and fairly and that the claims process must be transparent and efficient.  I will continue to advocate for legitimate claims and ensure that the Alabamians affected by the Gulf Coast oil spill receive just compensation.”
