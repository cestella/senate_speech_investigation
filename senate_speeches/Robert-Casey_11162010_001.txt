U.S. Senator Bob Casey today denounced the possible protest outside the funeral services for Specialist Dale Kridlo.  Members of the Kansas-based Westboro Baptist Church have frequently protested at funerals for fallen troops.

“The protesters should respect the sacrifice of Specialist Kridlo and his family by going back to Kansas and thank God that our country has brave men and women who defend our freedom,” said Senator Casey.  “If this cruel protest goes forward, I hope that the people of Pittston will come out to honor Specialist Kridlo and shield his family from this senseless stunt.”

Earlier this year, Senator Casey signed on to an amicus brief filed to support a U.S. Supreme Court case to protect the right of families to not have military funeral services disrupted by protests.  The Snyder v. Phelps case was filed by the father of Marine Lance Cpl. Matthew Snyder after his funeral was protested in 2006.  Albert Snyder is a resident of York, Pa.
