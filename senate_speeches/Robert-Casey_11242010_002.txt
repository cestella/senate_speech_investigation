U.S. Senator Bob Casey today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has awarded $94,832 to three fire companies in South Central Pennsylvania.

“Firefighters are invaluable members of our community and they work tirelessly to ensure our safety. It is critical that we do everything in our power to provide them with the necessary tools and resources to perform their jobs,” said Senator Casey. “This money will provide valuable assistance to the fire departments of South Central Pennsylvania.”

Federal funds are awarded through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant program (AFG) which aims to strengthen the Nation’s first responders’ ability to protect the health and safety of the public as well as the responders’ themselves. The grants are available through the Operations and Safety (O&S) program area of the AFG.
