WASHINGTON -- Today, the Senate passed the James Zadroga Act to guarantee medical screening and treatment and compensation for responders who were made sick by the toxic air around Ground Zero. U.S. Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ), who introduced the first version of the Zadroga bill in the Senate, hailed the passage after Congress considered the issue for more than six years:

"James Zadroga was a New Jersey resident and New York City police officer who selflessly spent 450 hours at Ground Zero helping the recovery efforts, breathing toxic air with nothing to protect his lungs but a paper mask. In fact, for nine years a paper mask was all that heroes like James were ever given to protect their health. Today, that changed.

“For thousands of 9/11 heroes, this might be the first merry Christmas they've had in nine years. Those who were made sick by the toxic air that hung over Ground Zero can finally be assured that they will have the medical attention they desperately need.

“A grateful nation honors the responders not just at 9/11 commemorations, but by ensuring that their health is protected. Finally, we are showing the type of gratitude that these heroes have always deserved. And as we do, we must never forget those who have already died as a result of their patriotic desire to respond when their nation called."
