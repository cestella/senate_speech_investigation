WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) today announced approval of two grants worth almost $18 million for ongoing work to rehabilitate the Biloxi water and wastewater systems and to reimburse the state of Mississippi for emergency response costs incurred immediately following Hurricane Katrina.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in consultation with congressional appropriations committees, has given final approval to grant requests from the city of Biloxi and the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA).

“These grants represent ongoing work by the federal government to assist Mississippi in overcoming the significant damage caused by Hurricane Katrina and to ensure that the Gulf Coast region is prepared to weather future emergency situations,” said Cochran, the vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a member of the subcommittee that funds FEMA. 

“In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, many communities found their water systems failing, forcing the state to respond quickly,” said Wicker.  “This FEMA grant helps the Biloxi area improve its capability ahead of future storms.”

A $16.6 million FEMA Public Utilities grant has been approved to support continued work to repair or replace Biloxi water and wastewater infrastructure damaged during the 2005 hurricane season.

Another $1.28 million FEMA Emergency Protective Measures grant was approved to reimburse MEMA for costs associated with law enforcement personnel and services provided by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission following Hurricane Katrina.

FEMA is covering 100 percent of the costs associated with both grants.
