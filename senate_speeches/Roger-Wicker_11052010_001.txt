WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker today announced the approval of more than $1.74 million in federal transportation funding to support two interstate highway improvement projects in Mississippi.

The Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) will receive the funding from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for U.S. Highway 78/Interstate 22 upgrade work in northwest Mississippi and for reconstruction of a segment of Interstate 20 in Scott County.

“The interstate highway system supports an increasing population and growing commercial sector in Mississippi.  This federal highway funding will be used to improve segments of I-22 and I-20 to maintain their usefulness to our state,” Cochran said.

“This funding will help enhance highway safety along important sections of I-20 and the I-22 upgrade,” said Wicker.  “Improving Mississippi highways promotes economic development opportunities and job creation for growing communities throughout the state.”

MDOT will receive $943,218 in FHWA Transportation, Community and System Preservation Program funds to upgrade U.S. Highway 78 to interstate highway standards.  This is a 33.3-mile project extending from the Coldwater River Bridge in DeSoto County southeast through Marshall County to the Benton County line.  The project would include paving improvements, lengthening exit and entrance ramps, bridge bearing pad replacements, and other improvements.

Another $800,000 has been awarded to support the reconstruction of four lanes of Interstate 20 between State Roads 481 and 501, in addition to mill and overlay work on the interstate from State Road 501 to the Newton County line.  This funding is allotted from the FHWA Interstate Maintenance Discretionary Program.
