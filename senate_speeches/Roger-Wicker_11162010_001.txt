WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) issued the following statement today announcing that he will vote in favor of a resolution in the Republican conference to place a moratorium on earmarks in the 112th Congress:

“Today, I will vote for the proposed moratorium on earmarks. During my time in public service, I have made it a priority to listen to the needs and concerns of Mississippians. The people have been loud and clear about their desire to clean up the out-of-control spending in Washington, and I am listening. The message from home is strong and my job is to represent their voices. Banning earmarks now is an important first step demonstrating that we are serious about the debt and runaway spending.

“While I have concerns about turning over more power to the administration and federal bureaucrats, I think it is important that Congress take a timeout and review the earmark process. I am committed to cutting spending and getting our fiscal house in order, and that means changing the way business is done in Washington.”
