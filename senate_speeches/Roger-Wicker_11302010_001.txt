WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) issued the following statement today regarding the release of the Defense Department’s report on the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy:

“I remain concerned about unit cohesion and the impact this implementation may have on our fighting force. It appears that this report on a controversial issue has been politically initiated to deliver on campaign promises. Reversing this policy at a time when our service men and women are actively engaged on two difficult fronts could take attention from the mission at hand.  I will thoroughly review the Pentagon’s report to ensure our Armed Forces can maintain troop morale and battle effectiveness.  At hearings later this week, Secretary Gates and other Department of Defense officials will need to address these issues.”
