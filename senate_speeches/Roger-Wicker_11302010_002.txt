WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) issued the following statement today after voting against S.510, the Food Safety bill:

“It is important that we modernize our food safety efforts, but we should do so in a way that does not unduly burden our food producers and add to the national debt. Unfortunately, there were not enough improvements made to this bill to address my concerns. This legislation includes a $1.5 billion price tag and would greatly expand the federal workforce.

“I believe the alternative offered by Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn was a better plan to ensure greater food safety without spending billions of dollars and creating new burdensome regulations.”
