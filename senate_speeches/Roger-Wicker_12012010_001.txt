WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) issued the following statement today regarding the Obama administration’s proposal to ban new oil drilling in waters off the East Coast for at least the next seven years:

“This seven-year ban on offshore drilling threatens American jobs and our country’s energy security. At a time when unemployment is near double digits nationwide, the federal government should not be implementing policies that would send American jobs overseas.

“America needs a balanced and responsible energy approach to decrease our dependence on foreign oil, and that plan must include producing domestic resources. The decision to lock up some of our offshore energy resources is another example that this administration is not serious about producing American energy and creating jobs.

“The tragic accident on Deepwater Horizon should not be used as a tool to advance an anti-drilling agenda. We need to find out what went wrong on Deepwater Horizon and how we can ensure the safety of the public and the environment.”
