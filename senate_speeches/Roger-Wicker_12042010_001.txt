WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) issued the following statement today after voting against two Senate measures that would have raised taxes on Americans:
 
"Hitting American job creators with a massive tax increase is not the way to respond to an economy with a national unemployment rate near 10 percent for 19 consecutive months. The policies of this administration have done little to help generate jobs. In fact they have had just the opposite effect.
 
“We need to promote a pro-growth environment for businesses that allows job creators to expand and hire. The most important thing we can do right now to help the economy and the millions of people struggling to make ends meet is prevent tax hikes from hitting Americans and small businesses.”
 
In September, Wicker cosponsored the Tax Hike Prevention Act that would extend the current tax cuts, permanently fix the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), and provide estate tax relief. Click here for more information on the Tax Hike Prevention Act.
 
Earlier this week, Wicker joined Republican Senators in signing a letter to Majority Leader Harry Reid announcing that they would not support consideration of any legislative item until the Senate prevents the upcoming tax increases and funds the government.
