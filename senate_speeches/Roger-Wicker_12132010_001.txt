WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) today met with Canadian National Railroad officials to discuss a proposed flag stop in Marks, Mississippi.  Canadian National Railroad operates the rail line running through Marks.

“This stop in Marks would benefit Quitman County and the surrounding area by creating important economic opportunities and more choices for travelers,” said Wicker.  “Canadian National should give strong consideration to the local community and Amtrak’s interest in initiating service in Marks.  I will continue to work to make this a reality.”

Marks and the neighboring counties support a new train station and passenger service.    Amtrak’s The City of New Orleans, a Memphis to New Orleans route, would serve the proposed stop, which Amtrak has found would be profitable for the rail network.  If approved, trains would stop only for pre-scheduled traffic. 

The North Delta has been without a rail stop since the Batesville station closed more than a decade ago, and the Marks proposal would replace that previous service.  Officials in Quitman County and members of the Delta Council have backed the service.  In November, the Delta Council wrote to Wicker, saying, “Presently, there are no stops on this route between Greenwood and Memphis, and the effort by leaders in Marks is important for passengers throughout Northwest and North Central Mississippi.”
