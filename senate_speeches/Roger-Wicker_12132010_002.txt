WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) issued the following statement today regarding the federal court ruling in Virginia declaring the health care law unconstitutional:

“I have long said that forcing Americans to purchase health care insurance infringes upon personal liberty and oversteps the Constitution. I am encouraged by today’s federal court ruling that the individual mandate in Obamacare is unconstitutional. This ruling is a step in the right direction to overturn the Democrats’ health care law and replace it with affordable options for Americans.”
