WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) issued the following statement today after voting in favor of bringing the tax extension bill to the Senate floor for debate:

“The most important thing Congress can do right now to help American families and small businesses is to prevent tax increases from going into effect on Jan. 1. The tax relief extension allows Mississippians to maintain the current tax rates that have been in place for nearly a decade. I hope Congress passes this important legislation so Americans and job creators will have the certainty needed to plan, invest, and grow our economy.”
