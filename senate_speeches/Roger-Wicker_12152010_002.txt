WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) issued the following statement today after voting to prevent tax hikes from hitting Americans on Jan. 1, 2011:

“Raising taxes on any American family or small business would further strain our weak economic recovery. Extending the existing tax rates helps create stability so businesses can invest and hire. Preventing the largest tax hike from hitting Americans is one of the many steps we need to get our economy back on track.

“I am glad that the Senate’s year-end tax package also includes a continuation of my GO Zone bond and bonus depreciation provisions to help the Gulf Coast attract private investment and create jobs.  These GO Zone provisions provide important tools to spur economic development in the hard hit areas along the Gulf.”
