WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) issued the following statement today after the President signed into law the legislation extending current tax rates for all Americans:

“With the President’s signature, this law extends the current tax rates for two years, giving some certainty to small businesses and entrepreneurs to help them grow and add jobs.  I am glad Congress stopped the largest tax hike in history from hitting any Americans.  We should focus on creating an environment that promotes job creation.

“This bill also helps the Mississippi Gulf Coast continue the rebuilding process.  The economic opportunities created through the GO Zone provisions provide this important region the ability to grow and prosper again.”
