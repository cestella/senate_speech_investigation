WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) issued the following statement today after the Senate voted to repeal the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy:

“Six weeks ago, the American people sent a loud and clear message that Washington needs to go in a different direction.  Unfortunately, that message has been ignored as Majority Leader Reid and the Democrat leadership try to ram through a politically-charged, liberal agenda during this lame duck session.  In their rush, no amendments have been allowed, and the debate has been cut short.  This is not how the Senate should operate.

“Our service men and women remain engaged in two conflicts.  I am concerned today’s vote adds to their very difficult work.  Forcing the implementation of a controversial policy takes focus off of the critical mission we are asking these brave warriors to accomplish.  Congress should heed the will of the American people, and stop rushing through contentious policies like a repeal of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.’”
