WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) today issued the following statement after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to impose broad regulations over the Internet:

“The FCC's party-line vote today to create so-called net neutrality rules on the Internet forces cumbersome and unnecessary government mandates, stifling one of our country’s most innovative sectors.   No clear authority or justification to do so exists for the FCC.  The Obama Administration seems determined to inject government controls into this and other marketplaces, further hurting the economy and investments in job creation.  I applaud Commissioners McDowell and Baker for their principled opposition, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to quickly put an end to these unnecessary regulations and returning true certainty to our marketplace.”
