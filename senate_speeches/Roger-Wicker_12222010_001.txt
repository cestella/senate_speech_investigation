WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) today supported the Defense Authorization Bill, which gives authority for Department of Defense (DoD) spending and decision-making for FY2011.

“I remain committed to ensuring our servicemen and women have the resources they need to accomplish the very difficult mission asked of them, and this Defense Authorization achieves that goal,” said Wicker, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  “Republicans stood firm against attempts to add controversial, liberal priorities into this important legislation including a measure to expand abortions to military medical facilities. This responsible authorization bill for the Department of Defense will help our troops in the field and here at home.”   

A Defense Authorization Bill must be passed annually to set priorities for funding and resources needed to support our troops.  This measure gives both short and long-term direction to the Pentagon and U.S. military leaders operating around the world.

Earlier this year, Senator Roland Burris (D-Ill.) included language in a previous version of the Defense Authorization bill that would have reversed a long-standing ban on the use of DoD medical facilities both foreign and domestic to perform abortions. Under the current law, DoD is restricted from using funds for abortions to be performed by medical personnel or in medical facilities except in the cases where the life of the mother is at risk or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.  Senator Wicker strongly opposed the Burris language, which was removed before the bill passed.
