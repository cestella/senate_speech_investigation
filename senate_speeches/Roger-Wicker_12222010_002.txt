WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) today issued the following statement after voting against the resolution of ratification of the START Treaty:

“I remain concerned this treaty hurts our ability to defend America in the coming years.  A rushed attempt to ratify the START Treaty in the waning days of a lame duck session of Congress further alarms me.  Tying our hands now unwisely limits us in this changing world.”
