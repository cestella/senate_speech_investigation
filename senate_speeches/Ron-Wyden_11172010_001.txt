Portland OR – Senator Ron Wyden  issued  the following statement today on The White House nominations of Oregon Assistant Attorney General Amanda Marshall as U.S. Attorney for Oregon and Lane County Sheriff Russel Burger as Oregon U.S. Marshal.

“Amanda Marshall has been a successful criminal prosecutor in Coos County as well as an assistant attorney general in the Oregon Department of Justice where she earned the reputation as a tireless advocate for children and families. As U.S. Attorney, Amanda will be a partner with me and others in the community in the battle to stop human trafficking and prosecute those who prey on children.

“Sheriff Burger has 21 years of experience at every level of law enforcement, including patrol, corrections, emergency management and training and professional standards. That background combined with his experience in administration and budget make him an outstanding choice as Oregon’s U.S. Marshal.

“I believe Ms. Marshall and Sheriff Burger deserve quick confirmation by the Senate.”
