Portland – The 442nd Regimental Combat Team of the United State Army was composed of mostly Japanese Americans who fought in Europe during World War II while many of their friends and families were held in internment camps back home in the United States. The unit became the most highly decorated regiment of its size in the history of the United States Armed Forces with 21 Medal of Honor recipients. The motto of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team was “Go for broke”.

Earlier this year, Congress passed and the President signed legislation honoring the “Nisei” soldiers of the 442nd, several of whom are living in Oregon. The law also recognizes the Japanese-Americans of the Military Intelligence Service who acted as interpreters during the war in the Pacific and after.

At Saturday’s event, Senator Wyden will present each of these soldiers a framed replica of the new law. At the same time, he will help open the Oregon Nikkei Legacy Center’s new exhibit titled “Taken” about the treatment of Japanese-American men in the days and weeks following the attack on Pearl Harbor.
