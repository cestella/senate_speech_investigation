Dear Friends,

Today, we are one giant step closer to ending the scourge of human sex trafficking once and for all.

The United States Senate has passed legislation that I sponsored with Senator John Cornyn of Texas that will help the victims of sexual trafficking and give law enforcement the tools it needs to prosecute those who prey on women and girls.

Now it’s time for the House of Representatives to go to work and not leave Washington before this job is done.

I’m calling on all of you to contact your Congress member as soon as possible and let them know that they need to stand up for all the children who are being exploited for sex.

Tell them not to leave Washington without passing the Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking Deterrence and Victims Support Act (S. 2925). Call 202-224-3121 or email your member.

Sex trafficking is slavery pure and simple. Let’s end it now.

U.S. Senator Ron Wyden
