With a deadline approaching, U.S. Senator Russ Feingold wants service members and veterans to be aware of compensation for which they may be eligible through their military service.  In 2009, Congress approved Retroactive Stop Loss Special Pay, which allows for eligible individuals who had their enlistment extended, or retirement suspended, between September 11, 2001 and September 30, 2009 to receive $500 for each month served past their contracted end of service date.  There are more than 145,000 service members and veterans who are eligible, but fewer than half have claimed the compensation.  All eligible individuals must submit their claim by December 3rd, 2010.   

“Unfortunately, fewer than half of eligible individuals have claimed this stop loss compensation for their extended service to our country,” Feingold said. “It is our responsibility to make sure our brave men and women in uniform receive the care and benefits they have more than earned for their courageous service to our nation.”   

Feingold has long raised concerns about the effects of multiple and extended deployments on our service members.  In 2005, Feingold successfully included a provision in the defense authorization bill for 2006 that prevented the military from misleading recruits about the total amount of time they may be required to serve.  As a result of Feingold’s amendment, the military changed the enlistment form to clearly state that enlistees can be held on active duty after the expiration of their contracts.  In 2007, Feingold sent a letter to Secretary Gates asking what the Department of Defense was doing to limit the use of stop loss and on March 18, 2009, DoD announced that it would eliminate the use of stop loss by January 2010.
