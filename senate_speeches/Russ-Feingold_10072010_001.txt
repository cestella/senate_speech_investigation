U.S. Senator Russ Feingold announced today that more than 60 Wisconsin small businesses have already received loans to expand, create jobs and help move our economy forward as a result of the recently enacted Small Business Jobs Act.  A complete list of the Wisconsin businesses is below. Feingold supported the bill, which was signed into law on September 27, 2010.  Today, Wisconsin small business owners joined Feingold in highlighting how the bill helps small businesses in Wisconsin.

“Small businesses are the engine of our economy and create the majority of jobs nationally,” Feingold said.  “But the lack of available credit has really hurt small businesses’ ability to expand and create new jobs.  That is why I supported the Small Business Jobs Act, which as we now see, is already helping free up credit for Wisconsin small businesses and moving our economy forward.”

Russ Klisch, the owner of Lakefront Brewery in Milwaukee, says the small business bill helps businesses like his create jobs.  Today, it was announced that Lakefront Brewery received a loan of $1,425,000 to help it expand and create jobs.

“The SBA loan will allow us to hire local contractors to enlarge our tour center, buy equipment from local Wisconsin manufactures to expand our brewery, and improve our distribution terminal.  From these expansions I'll be looking to hire three more full time employees in our brewery and six more part time in our tour center.  Our brewery currently produces a gluten free beer in which 10 percent of our production is exported and another 20 percent goes out of state.  The loan will enable us to improve our distribution center to help us meet our growing demand for our product,” Klisch said.

Cindy Haley is the President of J&C Trucking, which recently announced it was relocating to Baldwin in November where it is constructing a 9,100 square foot facility, creating 19 new jobs and bringing with it another 31 jobs.  J&C Trucking received an SBA loan of $284,000. 

“We are so excited to make the move to the state of Wisconsin. Everyone in Baldwin is so nice to work with. We will be using the money for our new facility to be constructed by Durand Builders,” said Haley.

Dr. Carin LaCount is an optometrist with Family Focused Vision Care in Sherwood.  Despite the fact that her practice is growing and loan payments have never been missed, her lender is requiring her SBA loan be 90 percent guaranteed.  As a result of the new small business bill, Family Focused Vision received a loan of $285,000 to help it stay open.

“This bill will ensure the success of my practice and I'm sure many other businesses. Efforts like these are what needs to be done in this economy and I appreciate Senator Feingold’s support to help small businesses like mine,” LaCount said.
