“I thank Secretary Sebelius for visiting Wisconsin today to announce these critical investments in our Community Health Centers made possible by the new health insurance reform law.  Wisconsin has 17 Community Health Centers, which provide affordable health care to hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites.  This first round of investments announced today will help Community Health Centers in Kenosha and Milwaukee provide even more Wisconsinites with the high-quality health care they need.”   

In March, Feingold was named the 2010 Distinguished Community Health Superhero by the National Association of Community Health Centers for his efforts to preserve, strengthen and expand access to America’s health centers and providers of high-quality health care.
