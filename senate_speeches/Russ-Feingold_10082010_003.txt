“While today's report shows continued positive but modest private sector job growth, clearly more must be done to spur employment and help more Wisconsinites get back to work.  We have taken some important steps to spur job creation, including passing the small business jobs bill, which has already resulted in loans for more than 60 Wisconsin small businesses to help them create jobs and move our economy forward.  But more must be done. In order to fuel job creation, I will continue to push for my aggressive jobs tax credit proposal, which would extend and expand the current jobs tax break to help a wider array of businesses hire more people or increase their hours.”
