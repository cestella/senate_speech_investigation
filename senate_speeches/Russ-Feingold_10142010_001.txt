 U.S. Senator Russ Feingold is standing up for Wisconsin homeowners, calling on the Treasury Department to do everything it can to prevent abusive foreclosure practices by financial institutions.  Several major mortgage servicers have halted foreclosure proceedings due to recent allegations involving faulty practices and deceptive foreclosure documents.  Some of these mortgage servicers received taxpayer assistance from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), also known as the Wall Street bailout, which Feingold opposed.  The Wall Street bailout explicitly states that the Treasury Secretary must ensure mortgage servicers are working to preserve homeownership.  In a letter to Secretary Geithner today, Feingold and Senator Herb Kohl have asked for a detailed explanation of what the Treasury Department is doing to ensure all financial institutions that have received TARP funding are working to preserve homeownership. 

“I am very troubled by the possibility that Wisconsinites may have been unfairly thrown out of their homes,” Feingold said. “I’d like to know what the Treasury Department and Secretary Geithner are doing to protect Wisconsin homeowners. I opposed the flawed Wall Street bailout, but if the government is going to provide taxpayer dollars to help big financial institutions, it should make sure those institutions are doing everything they can to help keep Americans in their homes.”

In late 2008, Feingold opposed the Wall Street bailout and has proposed canceling it as part of his Control Spending Now Act legislation. Along with canceling TARP, Feingold has supported further reforms to address the reckless actions that led to the near-collapse of our financial system. Feingold is a cosponsor of bipartisan legislation, introduced by Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and John McCain (R-AZ), to restore decades-old protective firewalls between Main Street banks and Wall Street securities firms and insurance companies. In 1999, Feingold was one of only eight senators to oppose the repeal of those safeguards. Their repeal contributed to the growth of mammoth “too big to fail” financial entities that taxpayers were asked to bail out in 2008.

Dear Mr. Secretary:

We are concerned about recent reports that several mortgage servicers have suspended foreclosures because of serious flaws in their foreclosure processes.  

Wisconsin is a judicial foreclosure state and several proceedings initiated by mortgage servicers accused of wrongdoing have been halted until further notice.  While Wisconsin and other states work to address this matter, we urge the Treasury Department to take all appropriate steps to prevent abusive practices.

The legislation authorizing TARP explicitly directs the Secretary of the Treasury to ensure that institutions benefiting from this assistance are operating in a manner that preserves homeownership.  The recent allegations against these mortgage servicers suggest that these institutions, all of which have received taxpayer funded assistance, may not be operating consistent with the spirit of the law.  We request a detailed explanation of how the Department of Treasury is implementing this particular aspect of the law.  Specifically, how has the Department of Treasury worked to ensure that all institutions that have received TARP funding are working to preserve homeownership to the greatest extent possible?  Additionally, how is the Department of Treasury working with these servicers to get this significant part of our nation’s financial system working properly to ensure that future disruptions of this magnitude do not occur again?

We urge you to advise institutions conducting foreclosure proceedings to first verify whether those foreclosures are eligible for the Making Homes Affordable Program or any other federal housing assistance program that might be an alternative to foreclosure.  It is important that we take all steps to ensure homeowners are not unfairly dispossessed during these difficult economic times.

We look forward to working with you to ensure that homeowners are aware of the assistance and other options that are available to them.
