Today, U.S. Senator Russ Feingold toured the new site of the La Crosse Vet Center that will open this December. The new La Crosse Vet Center will provide critical readjustment counseling for combat veterans as well as benefits assistance, employment services, and bereavement counseling for families. Since 2008, Feingold has led efforts to establish this Vet Center in La Crosse. 

“I am so pleased to see the progress in opening this new Vet Center for the veterans and their families in the La Crosse area,” Feingold said. “It is critical that we ensure that men and women in uniform who are returning from combat have access to the counseling they need. That is what they will find in a welcoming, community-based center like this Vet Center, and that is why I fought to establish this Vet Center in La Crosse and two others in Brown County and Wausau. I strongly encourage any combat veteran to stop by when the center opens in December to learn about the benefits to which they are entitled and about employment services for veterans.”

Feingold has worked hard to ensure Wisconsin’s veterans have access to the care they need. In addition to helping establish the new La Crosse Vet Center, Feingold led efforts to secure new centers in Brown County and Wausau, as well as increased assistance in Milwaukee and Madison. When all of the Centers are open, roughly 90 percent of Wisconsin veterans will live within an hour’s drive of a Vet Center. Before Feingold’s efforts, veterans in the western and northern parts of the state would have to drive all the way to Milwaukee or Madison to the south, Duluth to the northwest, the Twin Cities area to the west or Escanaba, Michigan.
