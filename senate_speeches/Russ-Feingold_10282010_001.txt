A report released by the National Taxpayers Union (NTU) and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (USPIRG) highlighting ways the federal government can reduce the deficit includes several efforts championed by U.S. Senator Russ Feingold in his Control Spending Now Act (CSNA).  The recommendations sent to President Obama’s bipartisan fiscal commission suggest ways for the government to slash wasteful spending including several Feingold-championed CSNA provisions like ending the Wall Street bailout, eliminating big agribusiness subsidies and cotton storage payments, reducing spending on unneeded defense spare parts and eliminating the V-22 Osprey. The NTU and USPIRG recommendations can be viewed here. 

“This report is full of ways the government can save taxpayer dollars, including several efforts I am pushing as part of my Control Spending Now Act,” Feingold said.  “These recommendations confirm that the huge subsidies and other government giveaways I am targeting hurt taxpayers.  With our country facing a massive deficit, Congress needs to tighten its belt. The efforts I have proposed, which are recognized in this report, are a great place to start.”

Feingold’s Control Spending Now Act is made up of more than 40 proposals to end egregious examples of wasteful government spending and institute reforms to prevent future problems. Feingold was recently ranked 5th by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation in a ranking of senators by their proposed cost savings, due in large part to the CSNA. According to the study, Feingold’s policy agenda would save $42 billion annually.

Feingold’s CSNA provisions recommended to the fiscal commission include:

Ending the Wall Street bailout (also known as the Troubled Assets Relief Program, TARP)
Reducing taxpayer subsidies for exporters of agricultural commodities
Eliminating cotton storage subsidies
Eliminating big agribusiness subsidies
Reducing spending on unneeded defense spare parts
Eliminating the V-22 Osprey
Cancelling high risk, unnecessary satellite
