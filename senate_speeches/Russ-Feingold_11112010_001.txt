“Today is a day to honor the generations of veterans who selflessly served their country in uniform.  Because of their service, it is our duty to ensure our veterans receive the care and benefits they have earned.  It has been a privilege for me to work throughout my career on behalf of our veterans, fighting for new outpatient clinics and Vet Centers, improving outreach efforts to ensure veterans know about the benefits they have earned and helping make sure veterans get their benefits in a timely manner.  And as we welcome back a new generation of veterans from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, we must remain committed to them and their families who have made innumerable sacrifices for the country we all cherish.”
