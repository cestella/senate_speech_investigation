U.S. Senator Sam Brownback expressed his objection to the use of federal tax dollars to fund overseas abortions. An amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, passed Thursday by the Senate Appropriations Committee, would permanently repeal what is commonly referred to as the Mexico City Policy. Mexico City Policy prohibits federal money to be used for international groups that promote or perform abortions.

"Regardless of a person's opinion of abortion, we should be able to agree that the funding of overseas abortions is a grave misuse of U.S. tax dollars," said Brownback. "We should support policies that promote the dignity of every human life. Furthermore, the federal government is broke and it shouldn't borrow money to pay for abortions overseas."

Mexico City Policy was first implemented by President Reagan in the 1980s. One of President Obama's first official acts as president was to sign an executive order which overturned the policy. The amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill would codify into law this executive order.
