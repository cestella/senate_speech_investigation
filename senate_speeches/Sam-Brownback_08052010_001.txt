U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today voted against the nomination of Elena Kagan to Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.

"I have too many questions about Elena Kagan's judicial philosophy to permit me to support her nomination to a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States," said Brownback. "A nominee's judicial philosophy is a key concern at the heart of the Supreme Court confirmation process. This concern is especially pertinent now in light of the more activist role the Court has taken in recent years."

Currently serving as Solicitor General, Kagan has no experience as a judge, making her the first Supreme Court Justice without prior experience on the bench in almost 40 years.

Brownback continued, "As I read about Ms. Kagan's experience and background and look for clues to her judicial philosophy, I believe it is very likely that she will rely on a set of political views to guide her decisions rather than a strict reading of the Constitution. After many weeks of public debate, hearings and discussion, I concluded that Ms. Kagan will only perpetuate judicial activism on the nation's highest court."
