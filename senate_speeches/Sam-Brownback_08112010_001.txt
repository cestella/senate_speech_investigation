U.S. Senator Sam Brownback welcomes Rex Ellis, Deputy Director of Curatorial Affairs of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, to Washburn University. The museum is to co-host a series of programs this weekend called "Save our African American Treasures: A National Collections Initiative of Discovery and Preservation."

"This is going to be a great opportunity for Kansans to learn more about their history," said Brownback. "From Bleeding Kansas to Brown v. Board, my home state played an important role in the fight for equal rights for African Americans."

The program runs Saturday, August 14, to Sunday, August 15, at Washburn University's Memorial Union in Topeka, Kansas. Area residents are encouraged to bring their antiques and artifacts to be appraised. Experts will also offer preservation tips.

The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture is scheduled to open in 2015. Brownback authored the Senate legislation that created the National Museum of African American History and Culture and has secured funding for the museum.
