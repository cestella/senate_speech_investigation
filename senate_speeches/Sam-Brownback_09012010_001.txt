U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on the expanded financial sanctions against North Korea.

“The increased financial sanctions against North Korea are certainly a step in the right direction, but they will only be as effective as their enforcement,” said Brownback.  “The United States must be unequivocal that North Korea’s hostile behavior and human rights violations will not be tolerated.  Therefore I urge the Treasury and State Departments to immediately and fully enforce the newly expanded sanctions.” 

 
An executive order was signed earlier this week that will allow the U.S. Treasury Department to freeze the assets of any person or entity found to be participating with North Korea in a wide range of activities, including narcotics trafficking, money laundering, arms sales, and the procurement of luxury goods.  In addition, the U.S. Departments of State and Treasury have found five North Korean entities and three individuals to be in violation of law and have specifically designated them for sanctions.
