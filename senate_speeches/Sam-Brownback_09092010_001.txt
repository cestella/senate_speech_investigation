U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today applauded five Kansas schools that have been designated by the U.S. Department of Education as Blue Ribbon Schools. The Blue Ribbon Schools Program recognizes high-achieving private and public schools and schools that have made substantial progress to close achievement gaps in student performance.

"There is no higher priority than to ensure our schools have the tools they need to succeed, that our fourth graders are reading at and above grade level and that our teachers are able to thrive in the education environment," said Brownback. "We should all commend our very best schools and offer them as examples of best practices for other schools, teachers and administrators all across Kansas. I applaud our 2010 Blue Ribbon Schools."

Representatives from the Blue Ribbon schools are invited to attend a November awards ceremony in Washington, D.C., hosted by Secretary of Education Arne Duncan.

The following Kansas schools were named Blue Ribbon Schools: Franklin Elementary School in Junction City; Garden Plain High School in Garden Plain; Lakeside Intermediate School in Cawker City; St. George Elementary School in St. George; and Woodlawn Elementary School in Lawrence.
