U.S. Senator Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) and U.S. Congressman Todd Tiahrt (R-Kan.) this week introduced companion resolutions in both the Senate and House of Representatives honoring the life of Dr. Ronald W. Walters, who organized the first silent sit-in at the Dockum Drug Store in Wichita, Kan., to protest segregated lunch counters. Click here to read the full text of the resolution.

Senator Brownback said, "Dr. Ronald Walters, a native Kansan, is a true hero of the civil rights movement. He spent the better part of his life courageously standing up to racism and intolerance. Because of Dr. Walters, and other civil rights activists like him, we live in a much freer society."

Congressman Tiahrt said, "Dr. Walters courageously faced adversity and helped transform our society through his successful organization of the first national sit-in. His leadership and contributions to our country should be remembered and honored. It is a privilege to join with Senator Brownback in honoring the life of Dr. Walters and his service as an ambassador for freedom and democracy."

As a result of the sit-in, Dockum Drug Store eliminated the segregated lunch counters. This success, organized by Dr. Walters, inspired others to organize similar sit-ins across the United States during the civil rights movement.

Dr. Walters passed away September 10, 2010, at the age of 72 in Silver Spring, Md.
