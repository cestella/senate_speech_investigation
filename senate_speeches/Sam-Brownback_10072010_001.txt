U.S. Senator Sam Brownback announced that award-winning Kansas City barbeque will be served tonight to soldiers and their families at the Fort Riley USO facility.

“Fort Riley soldiers and their families sacrifice a lot to serve our nation, and it is important that we show our appreciation,” said Brownback.  “It’s a privilege to have Rod Gray and his team, the Kansas City Barbecue Society Team of the Year, serve our troops some award-winning BBQ.”

Brownback worked with Rod and Sheri Gray of Pellet Envy BBQ Team to arrange tonight’s event, at which 250 soldiers and their families are expected to be in attendance.  Heath Hall and Brett Thompson of Pork Barrel BBQ will also help cook tonight’s meal.  Pellet Envy, the reigning Kansas City Barbecue Society Team of the Year, is a competitive barbecue team based in Kansas City.  Pork Barrel BBQ is an award-winning Washington, D.C.,-based barbecue sauce company.
