U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today commented on Major General Tod Bunting’s announcement that he is to retire and thanked him for his service as Adjutant General of Kansas. 
 
“Major General Tod Bunting has served the citizens of Kansas admirably,” said Brownback.  “His tenure as Adjutant General has been full of challenges, including tornadoes, floods, and ice storms; the training and deployment of Kansas Guardsmen to support the Global War on Terrorism; and the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure actions.  All Kansans should be grateful for General Bunting’s service to our state and our nation.”
 
Bunting has served as Adjutant General for seven years; he has been Chairman of the National Guard Association of the United States for the past two years.  Bunting’s retirement is effective January 2011.
