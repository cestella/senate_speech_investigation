U.S. Senator Sam Brownback today condemned North Korea for attacking the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong.

“North Korea has demonstrated once again that it is uninterested in peace or cooperation,” said Brownback.  “China should be embarrassed that its policy with North Korea is allowing the East Asian region to become destabilized.  China, North Korea’s benefactor, should stop providing financial and military assistance to North Korea, and instead assist the North Korean refugees flowing into China.”

North Korea today shelled Yeonpyeong, an island near the disputed border between North and South Korea which houses South Korean military installations and has a small civilian population.  The two states then exchanged artillery fire.  Two South Korean marines were killed; sixteen South Korean soldiers and three civilians were injured.  Villagers’ homes have been burned and destroyed.

Brownback in the past has sponsored legislation to aid North Korean refugees as well as legislation that would put North Korea back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism.
