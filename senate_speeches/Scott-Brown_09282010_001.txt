Today, U.S. Senator Scott Brown (R-MA) introduced the Arlington National Cemetery (ANC) Oversight Act to help prevent future cases of the egregious mismanagement that have surfaced in recent months at ANC.

The bill would establish strict requirements that the management of ANC must meet, while also giving Congress the ability to ensure and enforce these standards.

"Hello, I’m Scott Brown and I am privileged to serve the people of Massachusetts in the United States Senate.

“Many of you have probably heard the deeply troubling reports about severe mismanagement at Arlington National Cemetery. It has been confirmed that, in potentially thousands of cases or more, the cemetery has mis-marked graves, misidentified and mishandled the remains of America’s fallen heroes. This is simply unacceptable.

“Today, Chairman McCaskill and I are introducing a bill in the Senate to make sure that those responsible for managing the cemetery are being held accountable and meeting the highest standards when it comes to ensuring the proper burials of America’s fallen men and women.

“Our nation is grateful for the sacrifices our veterans and their families have made to keep us safe and our citizens free. The problems uncovered at Arlington National Cemetery have made national headlines and have tarnished a sacred trust with military families.  This bill will ensure that Service members families will never have to endure such devastating and emotional turmoil ever again.

“Thanks for listening.”
