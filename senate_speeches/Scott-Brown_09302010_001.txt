U.S. Senator Scott Brown (R-MA) yesterday introduced the “No Entry for Supporters of the Iranian Regime Act of 2010.”

This bill would prevent CEOs of companies from investing in Iran’s nuclear or missile programs or petroleum industry from entering the United States. Under Brown’s legislation, the Secretary of State would determine whether a company is in violation of existing U.S. sanctions against Iran, and the Secretary of Homeland Security would then create regulations to enforce the prohibition.

“A nuclear-armed Iran threatens both our national security and the stability of the Middle East, and my legislation gives our country another tool as we work to prevent the Iranian regime from crossing the nuclear threshold,” Senator Brown said. “Simply put, the heads of companies that invest in a terrorist regime should not be allowed to visit our country. This bill will force CEOs to choose between making profits in Iran or the ability to visit the United States. This legislation is an important step toward stopping the leading state sponsor of terror in the world from obtaining nuclear weapons.”
