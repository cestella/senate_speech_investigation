Today, U.S. Senator Scott Brown (R-MA) released the following statement in response to Commerce Secretary Gary Locke’s letter to the congressional delegation regarding emergency fishing regulations:

“Today’s announcement is a strong step forward for the struggling fishing industry in Massachusetts. Fishermen in our state continue to feel the pain of this recession and burdensome government regulation of their industry. To provide much needed relief for our fishermen, I strongly urge Secretary Locke to move quickly to raise catch limits so that businesses onshore and offshore can continue operating and we can keep these good-paying jobs in Massachusetts.”
