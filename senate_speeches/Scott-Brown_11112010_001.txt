Today, U.S. Senator Scott Brown (R-MA) issued the following statement on Veterans Day:

“Today, we pause to remember the brave men and women who have answered the call of duty to keep our country free and safe from her enemies. While we can never fully repay their service and sacrifice, we owe these heroes and their families our eternal gratitude and respect. Veterans Day offers our nation a chance to stand united as we honor the men and women who have given so much to protect the values and way of life we hold dear.”
