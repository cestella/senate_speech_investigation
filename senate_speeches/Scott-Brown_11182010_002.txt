U.S. Senator Scott Brown (R-MA) released the following statement after meeting with Danroy and Angella Henry today in Washington D.C.:

“I was saddened and disturbed by the shooting death of D.J. Henry, and like a lot of people, I was concerned by the events that preceded this incident. I sympathize with D.J.’s parents and how powerless they feel in attempting to find out what happened the night their son was killed, yet many of their questions remain unanswered. Currently, a grand jury is investigating this incident. I believe we owe it to all the parties involved to give the grand jury time to complete its work. In the meantime, my office will continue to monitor the case to make sure that a fair and thorough investigation is carried out in a timely manner and that D.J.’s family is finally given the answers they deserve.”
