U.S. Senator Scott Brown (R-MA) issued the following statement today on President Obama’s proposal to freeze federal pay raises:

“I applaud President Obama for taking action to rein in government spending by temporarily freezing federal employee wages. There is still more work to be done and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to control spending and reduce our national debt."
