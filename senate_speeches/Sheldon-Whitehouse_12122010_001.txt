The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides grants to states to implement mitigation measures after recovery from a disaster and for previously identified mitigation measures to benefit the area. 

As a result of this year’s flood disaster, Rhode Island became eligible to receive $11 million in funding for FEMA’s Hazard Grant Mitigation Program (HMGP).  Eligible HGMP activities include acquisition (and either demolition or relocation) of flood-prone homes, retrofitting buildings, and building floodwall systems.  The cost share for HGMP is 75% federal/25% state and local. 

The Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency (RIEMA) has officially announced the rollout of the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). RIEMA is encouraging all communities, state agencies, and private non-profit organizations to attend an information meeting to discuss the grant program, eligible project activities, the application and all other aspects of the process. Details for the meeting are below:

Date: Thursday December 16th, 2010

Location: Radisson Airport Hotel, 2081 Post Road Warwick RI 02886

Time: 1:00PM – 3:00PM
