Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) issued the following statement today after President Obama signed legislation to repeal the law banning gay men and women from serving openly in the military:

“Requiring gay and lesbian servicemembers to hide who they are went against the principles of integrity and responsibility on which our military stands. President Obama’s action today marks an historic win for equality and civil liberties, and also for our proud military as we continue to fight a war in Afghanistan.”

Whitehouse cosponsored legislation to repeal the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy.
