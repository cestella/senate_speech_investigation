U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Airbus Americas Chairman Allan McArtor addressed more than 250 Ohio aerospace companies at today’s Airbus Procurement Summit held at the Ohio State University.  Ohio companies met with leaders from Airbus Americas and its key direct suppliers at the third Ohio procurement summit aimed at strengthening the state’s aerospace industry and fostering growth in Ohio’s partnership with Airbus.

 “This is about positioning Ohio as the national leader in aerospace manufacturing and creating new jobs,” Brown said. “Following the success of our first two conferences in Cleveland and Dayton, we are continuing to build on Ohio’s rich aerospace heritage and to push for companies like Airbus and its main suppliers to do more business in Ohio.  These opportunities will help more Ohio companies to be considered for Airbus contracts as well as to find opportunities with GE Aviation, RTI, and other Tier 1 and 2 suppliers. For the first time, Airbus also brought new Tier 1 suppliers from out-of-state to provide additional business opportunities to Ohio suppliers.  This contributes to our goals to expand business, maintain and create more jobs, and generate economic activity in our communities.”

 Also speaking at the conference was Airbus Americas Chairman Allan McArtor, who underscored the importance of the partnership between Airbus and Ohio suppliers.  In Oct. 2009, McArtor announced the formal partnership on a news conference call with Sen. Brown.  More information can be found HERE.

“Airbus is celebrating its 40th year in business this year – and every one of those years has been in partnership with the Ohio aerospace industry,” said McArtor.  “Our economic footprint in the U.S. has grown dramatically over the years, and Ohio is the state where we spend the most.  Of the $10 billion Airbus spent in the U.S. last year, more than $4 billion was invested with Ohio companies.  Ohio is a high-tech, strong aerospace state, and with a business-minded government approach we see an excellent basis where Airbus and its key suppliers could further increase its links with Ohio. The fact that this time we brought along Spirit Aerosystems and Rockwell Collins from outside the state brings even more business opportunities to Ohio. Our previous conferences in Cleveland and Dayton gave us and the tier one suppliers present some good leads, and we want to achieve the same here today in Columbus,” he added.

 Currently, there are more than 1,200 companies that support more than 120,000 jobs in Ohio’s aerospace industry.  Today’s conference enabled Ohio suppliers and aerospace companies to become acquainted with Airbus’ procurement processes and guidelines, to hear first-hand experiences from key subcontractors, and to meet one-on-one with Airbus and Tier 1 officials.

 With an estimated $4.3 billion in direct Airbus procurement in 2009, Ohio ranks first in Airbus spending in the United States.  Since 1990, Airbus has invested more than $100 billion in the United States, working directly with hundreds of suppliers and supporting more than 180,000 jobs.

 The first Airbus Supplier Summit was held in December 2009 at Cleveland’s Ohio Aerospace Institute.  The second summit was held in Kettering at the National Composite Center in April 2010.  Brown helped organize all three events.
