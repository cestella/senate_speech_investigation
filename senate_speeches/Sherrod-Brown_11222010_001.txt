 Following the announcement by Major League Baseball, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown congratulated Joey Votto who was named the 2010 National League’s Most Valuable Player today.  

“Not since Barry Larkin led the Reds to the National League Championship Series in 1995 has a Reds player been recognized as MVP. But Joey Votto’s near unanimous choice for MVP shows that Cincinnati produces outstanding talent,” Brown said. “After unjustly being overlooked for the All-Star team, Votto matched a spectacular first half of the season with an impressive Triple Crown chase down the stretch. All the while, Joey helped carry the Reds to their first playoff appearance in fifteen years.  I’m hopeful that his power, poise, and skill will be on display in Cincinnati for years to come.”

The Reds first baseman had a .324 batting average this season and led the team to their first NL Central title since 1995. He is the first Cincinnati Reds to earn the NL MVP honor since Barry Larkin in 1995.  In July, Sen. Brown attended the ‘Vote Votto’ lunch where he cast his vote for Joey Votto to play in the 2010 All-Star game.
