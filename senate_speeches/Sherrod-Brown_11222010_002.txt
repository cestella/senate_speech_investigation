 In advance of the Thanksgiving holiday and in the wake of new U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data showing nearly one in seven Ohio families to be “food insecure,” U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) served meals and thanked volunteers at the Good Neighbors Food Pantry in Akron today. Brown also released a report showing the increased demand for services provided by food pantries and food banks in the Akron area.

 “This Thanksgiving, many of us will be fortunate enough to enjoy a satisfying—if not entirely healthful—holiday meal. But every day hundreds of thousands of families in Ohio and millions more nationwide struggle to put food on the table,” Brown said. “During the holiday season—and year-round—food pantries like Good Neighbors and the Akron-Canton Regional Foodbank provide an invaluable service to thousands of Ohioans who would otherwise go hungry.

 “We learned last week that a staggering one in seven Ohio families don’t have enough access to food, and we know that many Ohioans live in ‘food deserts’ where they cannot easily access fresh, nutritious produce,” Brown continued. “To date this year, Good Neighbors has served more than 6,547 area families, including 7,396 children—an increase of 65 percent from 2008. We must do more to combat hunger and make sure that Ohioans can continue to put food on the table for their families.”

 According to the USDA, the term “food security” refers to the “assured access to enough food for an active, healthy life” and for that food to be nutritious, safe, and easily obtainable through normal channels.

Brown has been a leader in the Senate on issues relating to hunger and nutrition. As Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Subcommittee on Hunger, Nutrition, and Family Farms, Brown helped craft the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, which the Senate passed in August. That same month, Brown joined community leaders in Youngstown to outline efforts to fight childhood hunger and eradicate “food deserts.”
