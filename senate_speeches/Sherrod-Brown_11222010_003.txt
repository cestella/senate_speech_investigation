Following U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown’s meeting with GE Aviation officials, the company announced today that it will locate a new research and development center on the campus of the University of Dayton.  

 “In Ohio, we have a strong legacy of creating partnerships that spur innovation and economic growth,” Brown said. “The University of Dayton and General Electric Aviation are doing more than building a collaboration between private industry and higher education. Together, they are contributing to the Ohio Aerospace Hub of Innovation that will make Ohio even more attractive to 21st century technology firms and the engineers, researchers, and leaders who will keep Ohio at the forefront of clean energy technology development.”

 In October 2010, Brown met with GE Aviation officials advocating for the placement of the EPISCENTER at the University of Dayton campus. Currently, there are more than 1,200 companies that support more than 120,000 jobs in Ohio’s aerospace industry. Brown is working to enhance Dayton’s reputation as Ohio’s Aerospace Hub. He is working to bring a shuttle to the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Museum and hosted the Airbus Supplier Conference at the National Composite Center in April 2010 in Kettering. 

 The $50 million Electrical Power Integrated Systems Research and Development Center (EPISCENTER) will be located on River Park Drive. The 115,000 square foot facility is expected to be operational by the end of 2012. In March of this year, GE announced it would build the EPISCENTER in or near Dayton
