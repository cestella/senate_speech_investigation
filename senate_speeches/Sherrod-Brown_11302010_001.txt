After receiving $48,000 in federal funds—with support from U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH)—the Lorain Fire Department today held a training for new, life-saving extrication equipment it was able to purchase with the grant.

“The men and women of the Lorain Fire Department put their lives on the line day in and day out, fighting fires and rescuing victims from the scene of car accidents and other crises,” Brown said. “Thanks to this Assistance to Firefighters Grant, the Department was able to purchase this state-of-the-art extrication equipment that will help save lives and allow these local heroes to do their important job safely.”

The Lorain Fire Department received $48,000 in funds from the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program offered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Thanks to the grant, the Lorain Fire Department was able to purchase extraction equipment used for confined area rescue.

Last year, 362 Ohio fire departments received more than $33 million dollars in Assistance to Firefighters Grants, according to FEMA. To view Ohio’s AFG Awards Announcements by city, click here.
