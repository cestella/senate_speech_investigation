U.S. Senator Susan Collins released this statement today following a phone call from Cianbro Chief Executive Officer Peter Vigue, in which he informed the Senator about Cianbro's acquisition of Starcon International, Inc. According to Vigue, the acquisition by Cianbro represents a significant expansion that will launch one of the East Coast's largest diversified general contractors into the $12 billion refining and petrochemical service business, with nationwide presence. 

"Congratulations to Pete Vigue and his team at Cianbro for acquiring this substantial company with expertise in the petrochemical and refining business. This acquisition should help Cianbro bring more jobs to its Brewer facility and strengthen its expertise to compete for additional work. I so appreciate Cianbro's strong commitment to growing in Maine and creating good jobs in our State."
