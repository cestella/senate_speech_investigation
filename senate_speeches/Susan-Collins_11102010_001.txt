Bangor, Maine - U.S. Senator Susan Collins was on hand recently to honor one of the two Maine schools that received national recognition from the U.S. Department of Education this year. The James Doughty School in Bangor was recently named a "Blue Ribbon School of Excellence" for its exemplary student achievement. The Kennebunkport Consolidated School, which Senator Collins also visited recently, was also named a "Blue Ribbon School." 

The Blue Ribbon award, created by the Department of Education in 1982, is considered the highest honor an American school can obtain. Schools singled out for the honor are either academically superior in their states or demonstrate dramatic gains in student achievement. 

During her visit to the school on Thursday, Senator Collins gave a PowerPoint presentation to more than 100 sixth graders about her service as a U.S. Senator. She then joined the school for a special assembly, where she presented an official, framed copy of the Congressional Record statement she wrote congratulating the school on reaching "Blue Ribbon" status. 

"The James Doughty School is an example of what schools can achieve through hard work and a commitment to excellence shared by students, teachers, the principal and administrators, school board members, and parents," said Senator Collins. "Together, they have built a quality, caring and supportive educational environment that will help our children grow to become the leaders of tomorrow."
