The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has issued a report, requested by Senator Susan Collins and several of her colleagues, that examined the U.S. Navy's backlog of modernization and restoration projects at the Navy's four public shipyards, including the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery.  According to the report, the Navy's estimate of a $3 billion shortfall in modernization of the shipyards, including $513 million at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard alone, underestimates the actual backlog.   The report also notes that Portsmouth Naval Shipyard officials did not request more than $80 million in projects they believed were needed in the last two years because of Navy guidance constraining those project requests.  

"This report confirms what many of us have known for a long time - our public shipyards have not received adequate support or the attention that they deserve from the leadership in the Pentagon," said Senator Collins.  "What concerns me the most, is that this report suggests that there may be additional shortfalls beyond the $3 billion overall shortfall that the Navy has acknowledged, including $513 million at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard alone.   In addition to asking the Navy to begin funding projects that improve the safety and quality of life for the many workers at the shipyard, I will continue to seek support through my work on the Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee to help ensure the Shipyard is safe and efficient."
