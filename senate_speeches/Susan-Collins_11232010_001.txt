U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today released this statement after North Korea fired artillery shells at the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong:  

“I am deeply troubled by North Korea’s attack against South Korea.  I join the Administration in strongly condemning this action, which is in direct violation of the Armistice Agreement.”
