U.S. Senator Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) today encouraged members of the Armed Forces to utilize absentee voter assistance services offered by the Department of Defense.

This week, the Defense Department is promoting “Absentee Voting Week” (Sept. 27-Oct. 4) to disseminate information on voting and voting assistance through the Federal Voter Assistance Program (FVAP).  This initiative aims to educate and encourage military personnel and Americans living overseas to participate in the upcoming U.S. elections.

“As a whole, our nation benefits from broad voter participation, and that should include our men and women in uniform.  The Department of Defense has improved its use of electronic alternatives for completing a ballot, as well as its outreach to service members,” said Cochran, vice chairman of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.

“I encourage all military members, their dependents, and Department of Defense employees to learn how to take part in the electoral process.  The state of Mississippi is linked to the Federal Voter Assistance Project, which makes eligibility and balloting instructions available to Mississippians serving their country abroad,” he said.

Mississippi is one of 19 states participating in the FVAP’s voting support program, which offers precinct-specific online ballots and submission instructions.  The FVAP site includes information on Mississippi registration and balloting recommendations for overseas uniformed service members, their families and overseas Defense Department employees.  The state allows persons in these categories to receive ballots by mail, fax or email.

Improvements to the military voter assistance program were mandated by Congress in the FY2010 Defense Authorization Bill, which included provisions based on legislation cosponsored by Cochran last year to make it easier for military personnel and Americans living overseas to participate in U.S. elections.  Those changes to the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act required states and the Defense Department to take certain actions to improve voter participation among members of the military.
