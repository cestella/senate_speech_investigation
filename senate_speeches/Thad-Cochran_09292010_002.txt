 U.S. Senators Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) today introduced Justice James Graves of Mississippi to the Senate Judiciary Committee and recommended his confirmation to a federal judicial position.

Graves, who currently serves as a Presiding Justice on the Mississippi Supreme Court, has been nominated by the President to serve as a Circuit Court Judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  The committee held the hearing to receive testimony from Graves before determining whether to recommend Graves’ confirmation to the full Senate.

“I am pleased to recommend Justice Graves for confirmation by the Senate,” Cochran said.  “Justice Graves has built a professional and public service record that is admired by many in our state.”

“If confirmed by the Senate, Justice Graves will bring a rich, diverse, and distinguished background of public service to the Fifth Circuit,” said Wicker.  “Justice Graves has been recognized on numerous occasions with awards noting his true servant’s spirit, which I believe is a testament to his dedication to his family and community.  I support this nomination, and I hope the Senate will confirm his appointment to the federal bench.”

A native of Clinton, Miss., Graves was a Circuit Court Judge in Hinds County before being appointed to the Mississippi Supreme Court in 2001.  He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology from Millsaps College, a law degree from the Syracuse University College of Law, and a Master of Public Administration degree from Syracuse University.

During today’s hearing, Cochran and Wicker also recounted Graves’ legal career as well as his community service.
