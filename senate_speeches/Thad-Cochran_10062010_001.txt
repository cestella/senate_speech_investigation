 U.S. Senator Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) today recognized the work of Chris and Sue Cherney of Jackson, who are in Washington this week to be honored for their work to improve the lives of adoptive and foster care children throughout Mississippi.

Cochran nominated the Cherneys as Mississippi’s 2010 Angels in Adoption as part of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute’s 12th annual “Angels in Adoption” program.  The couple is in Washington to take part in events that promote adoption and honor more than 140 Angels in Adoption from around the country.

“Chris and Sue Cherney have for more than 20 years devoted their lives to helping children in need and finding nurturing homes for them.  Their dedication and hands-on efforts have touched the lives of many children who might otherwise have fallen victim to neglect or worse,” Cochran said.  “I am pleased that their mission will be recognized as part of the Angels in Adoption celebration.”

Mr. Cherney is the chief executive officer of Mississippi Children’s Home Services and Mrs. Cherney is executive director of Southern Christian Services for Children and Youth in Jackson.  Both organizations are focused on offering adoption, foster care, shelter and educational services to children and youth.

The Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute (CCAI) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization focused on increasing awareness about children in need of permanent, safe and loving homes, and on eliminating barriers to adoption.  CCAI, which does not receive government funding, was established in 2001 as an outgrowth of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption.
