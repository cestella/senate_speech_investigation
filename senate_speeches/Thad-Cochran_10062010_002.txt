U.S. Senators Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker today announced the approval of a $1.0 million grant request from the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) for a stand-alone saferoom shelter on the Stone County High School campus.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in consultation with congressional appropriations committees, has given final approval to MEMA’s application for funding for a 3,300-square-foot saferoom in Stone County to accommodate about 330 people for up to 36 hours during emergencies.

“One aspect of our state’s long recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita has been to establish saferoom shelters in south Mississippi.  This facility in Stone County will give residents an additional safe haven during emergencies,” said Cochran, who serves on the Senate appropriations subcommittee that funds FEMA.  “I am pleased this MEMA request has been approved and funded.”

“As we continue to rebuild from Hurricane Katrina, it is important that we find ways to strengthen our emergency preparedness efforts,” said Wicker. “This funding will help Stone County prepare and protect its residents from future hurricanes by providing much needed emergency shelters.”

The total cost of the $1,013,788 project in Stone County will be covered by the FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program award.

The FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program provides funding to states and local governments for long-term hazard mitigation activities designed to reduce the loss of life and property due to natural disasters.
