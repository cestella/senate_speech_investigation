 U.S. Senator Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) today issued the following statement regarding the decision by the U.S. Department of the Interior to lift the deepwater drilling moratorium imposed following the April 20 blowout of the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico:

“I am encouraged by the Interior Department’s decision to lift the deepwater moratorium, but I know that additional actions are necessary to ensure a viable offshore energy sector in the Gulf of Mexico.  There are substantial concerns that the federal regulatory and permitting processes will further delay jumpstarting deepwater energy production in the Gulf, as has been the case for shallow water production.  It is my hope that the administration will act diligently to provide regulatory and permit certainty to the industry so that workers can get back to the job of safely producing natural gas and oil in the Gulf.”
