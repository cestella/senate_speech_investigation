U.S. Senator Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) today issued the following statement to commemorate Veterans Day 2010:

“Each November, Americans honor all the veterans who have served to protect our great nation.  This national holiday is important not only because we salute the sacrifices made by our veterans, but also because their contributions remind us of the personal price required to secure and preserve the freedoms we enjoy in the United States.  This is a message that must not be forgotten.

“In Mississippi, we have a proud tradition of men and women serving in the Armed Forces, and these brave servicemen and women enjoy broad popular support among Mississippians.  I am pleased that this support is also extended to veterans, particularly those who call Mississippi home after their service to the nation.

“As we commemorate Veterans Day 2010, I encourage all Mississippians to honor the sacrifices made by generations of military men and women who fought for the principles of freedom, justice and democracy.”
