U.S. Senator Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, today issued the following statement regarding Senate passage of legislation to fund the Pigford II discrimination settlement agreement between African American farmers and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA):

“This legislation is offset and provides an avenue of recourse for farmers, many of them from Mississippi, for the discrimination claims they have against the Agriculture Department.  I am pleased the Senate has approved this settlement, and I hope the House will pass this measure soon after the Thanksgiving holiday.”

The Senate on Friday approved the Cobell/Pigford Claims Settlement Act (HR.4783), by unanimous consent.

The legislation has been pending since the settlement agreement reached in February between African American farmers, USDA, and the Department of Justice.  The settlement process is expected to be carried out similarly to the settlements reached in the late 1990s in the original Pigford v. Glickman suit.
