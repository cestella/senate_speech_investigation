Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) has selected Sanborn County as his November 2010 “County of the Month.” The county is highlighted in a special section of his website at http://johnson.senate.gov.

“Sanborn County is an important part of South Dakota’s rich history,” Johnson said.  “I’m proud to have helped support funding for economic development and infrastructure improvements across the community. I’m also pleased to see the continued benefits of the Recovery Act across the county.”

Sanborn County has much historical significance, and is home to many communities including, Woonsocket, Artesian, Forestburg and Letcher. The James River bisects the county providing choice land for hunting, fishing and recreation. The county is also famous for its artesian wells.

Johnson has worked hard to provide Sanborn County with federal assistance, including funding for the James River basin and local school districts.  Johnson has also secured more than $65 million in federal funds for the Mid-Dakota Rural Water Project, which provides clean water service to Sanborn County.

“I wanted to highlight one specific county each month to bring attention to our communities,” Johnson said.  “South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments—they are truly great places to live.”
