Washington, DC — U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD), a member of the Senate Energy Committee, today commented following an announcement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that it will delay a decision on a waiver to allow the use of E15 in 2001 through 2006 model year light-duty motor vehicles while testing continues. 

“I’m disappointed that the EPA has delayed this decision, but understand their efforts to make sure vehicle tests are completed thoroughly and appreciate that they are still moving forward so that consumers have additional fuel options in the marketplace.  Increasing ethanol blends is an important step toward meeting renewable fuels targets that help displace foreign oil and bring jobs to South Dakota,” said Johnson. 

The EPA took action in October that cleared the way for E15 to be used in model year 2007 and newer light-duty motor vehicles, which includes passenger cars, light-duty trucks and sport utility vehicles.

The EPA has authority for evaluating the effects of gasoline blends on vehicle or engine emissions control systems.  The current ethanol fuel blend of 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline (e.g. E10) was approved by the U.S. EPA in 1978.  That fuel blend is approved for non-flexible fuel vehicles (FFV’s), representing the vast majority of cars and trucks.  FFV’s can accommodate ethanol fuel blends up to 85 percent ethanol (E85).
