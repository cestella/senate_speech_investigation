Washington, DC — U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today urged South Dakotans interested in sending packages to our troops overseas in time for the holidays to do so via First Class or Priority Mail by December 4, 2010.

“Many members of our military are preparing to spend Christmas away from their families and I encourage South Dakotans to remember them in our thoughts and prayers,” Johnson said. “As the father of a servicemember, I know how important it is to feel connected to a family member so far away. I encourage those interested in sending packages to our troops overseas to do so by the deadline so they can share the joy of the holidays.”

Smaller packages about the size of a shoebox that weigh less than 20 pounds are recommended. All packages should include the soldier’s name, the organization to which they are assigned and their unit number.

Department of Defense requirements mandate that mail be sent to specific servicemembers, though organizations are in place that would deliver non-specific “Any Servicemember” packages.

“Operation USO” (www.usocares.org) provides a soldier with often requested items, including pre-paid worldwide phone cards, sunscreen, and toiletries, along with a personalized message from the donor. Sponsored by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, “Operation Uplink” (http://www.vfw.org/Assistance/National-Military-Services/) also provides soldiers with phone cards, and “Gifts from the Homefront” (http://www.armyg1.army.mil/WellBeing/RRLeave/AAFES.htm) has gift certificates available that soldiers can redeem at military exchanges.
