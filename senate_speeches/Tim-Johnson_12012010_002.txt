Washington, DC — U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD), a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, today cosponsored legislation to reauthorize funding for the Administration for Native Americans (ANA) through Fiscal Year 2016. The ANA, a part of the Department of Health and Human Services, oversees competitive grant programs that fund economic development, environmental and native language programs across Indian Country.  

“The Administration for Native Americans provides funding for projects that improve the lives of many individuals in Indian Country,” said Johnson, a member of the Indian Affairs Committee. “This bill will make sure that funding for the ANA does not fall by the wayside and these competitive grant programs can continue to help American Indians in our state and across the country.”

The ANA funds approximately 200 projects annually, including social and economic development grants that fund parenting and domestic violence programs and cultural programs that are designed to overcome high rates of depression, suicide, high school drop-outs and incarceration. The programs also aid business projects that promote self-sufficiency and self-governance.

Rosebud Sioux Tribe member Lillian Sparks is Commissioner for the ANA. Johnson supported her nomination before the Indian Affairs Committee earlier this year.
