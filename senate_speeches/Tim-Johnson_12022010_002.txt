Washington, DC — U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today announced that the U.S. Senate has unanimously passed legislation to designate the Federal building and United States courthouse located at 515 9th Street in Rapid City as the ‘‘Andrew W. Bogue Federal Building and United States Courthouse’’ in memory of the late federal court judge.

“As one of the leading legal minds in our state, this is a fitting tribute to Judge Bogue,” Johnson said. “I was proud to honor a distinguished judge who served not only on the bench, but in both World War II and the Korean War.”

Bogue was a native of Yankton and alum of State College in Brookings and the University of South Dakota Law School.  He was appointed to be a judge in United States District Court for the State of South Dakota in 1970 by President Richard Nixon and served until last year when he passed away at the age of 90. 

This bill was introduced by U.S. Representative Stephanie Herseth Sandlin (D-SD) and will now go to President Obama for his signature. Johnson introduced a Senate version of this legislation with U.S. Senator John Thune (R-SD) as a cosponsor.
