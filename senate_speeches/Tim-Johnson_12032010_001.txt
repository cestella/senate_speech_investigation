Washington, DCâ€”U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement as the Senate prepares to vote tomorrow on a series of measures regarding an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts:

These proposals are another step in the process of addressing the expiring Bush tax cuts, and include important provisions like an extension of unemployment benefits and protecting families from the Alternative Minimum Tax.

This is a politically charged issue, and the Administration continues to work with Congressional leaders from both parties. My top priority is continuing the tax cuts for those making up to $250,000 a year. I am hopeful that we can reach consensus on this as we work to complete this session of Congress and prevent the middle class from seeing a tax increase next year.

According to a report by the Senate Finance Committee, in 2008, 98 percent of the 389,575 of tax returns filed in South Dakota reported income at or under $200,000.
