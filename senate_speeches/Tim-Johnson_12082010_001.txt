Washington, DC — U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement in regard to President Barack Obama’s tax cut proposal:

I am still waiting to learn more about the details of the President’s tax cut proposal as legislative language hasn’t been delivered to Congress yet.  I appreciate that the President is looking for compromise, but I need to see the final details. 

Our initial goal was to pass a permanent extension of tax cuts for the middle class that would have even given the wealthiest Americans a tax cut up to the $250,000 limit, but Republicans held that plan hostage with a larger effort that will throw us deeper in debt during a recession and aid the richest of the rich.  That said, I don’t want to see a middle class tax hike during a recession.  The proposal will likely change in the coming days and I will be following developments closely.
