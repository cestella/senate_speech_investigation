Washington, DC — U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement in regard to the nomination Joseph Smith, Jr. to be Director, Federal Housing Finance Agency:

As our economy recovers, the regulators begin to implement the Dodd-Frank Walls Street Reform Act and we consider the future of the housing market, it is essential that the Federal Housing Finance Agency have leadership that is answerable to Congress.  The Director of FHFA has a unique role as regulator for the Federal Home Loan Bank system and both regulator and conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  This dual role requires a balance between protecting taxpayers and using the tools available to stabilize the housing market.

Mr. Smith is no stranger to this committee or to the challenges of implementing financial reforms.  As Commissioner of Banks, he was responsible for implementing and enforcing North Carolina’s anti-predatory lending laws, overseeing the state’s foreclosure prevention program and serving on the Governor’s task force to increase small business lending – to name a few of his accomplishments - all while regulating small and large financial institution in the state.    

Balancing consumer protection and credit availability, regulation and economic growth will be extremely important for creating a sustainable housing and economic recovery.
