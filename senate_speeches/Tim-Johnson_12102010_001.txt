Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that three tribes in South Dakota will receive grants totalling $680,668 from the Federal Transit Administration. The funding will be used to enhance transit services through expansion of existing routes and the purchase of new vehicles.

“Public transit is an important factor for quality of life for tribal communities in South Dakota,” said Johnson. “I am pleased that these funds will help ensure reliable public transit infrastructure in Indian Country. These investments in the public good are the kind of investments I support in my Hometown Prosperity Plan.”

The Oglala Sioux Tribe will receive a $250,000 grant to purchase busses to operate transit service on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe will receive a $200,000 grant to enhance its existing transit services. The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe will receive a $230,668 grant to purchase new vehicles, enhance existing transit services and expand its route to Chamberlain.

The Tribal Transit Program provides funds directly to support tribal public transportation in rural areas.

Senator Johnson's Hometown Prosperity Plan is a four-pillar agenda for advancing South Dakota's economy from the federal level. The four pillars, or strategies, include “Promoting Partnerships,” “Emphasizing Entrepreneurship,” “Investing in the Public Good,” and “Protecting Pocketbooks.” The full plan includes specific actions related to each strategy and can be downloaded from http://johnson.senate.gov.
