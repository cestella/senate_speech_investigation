Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) announced today that South Dakota State University will receive a $360,970 federal grant from the Department of Health and Human Service’s (HHS) Cardiovascular Diseases Research Program.  The funding will be used to study heart and cardiovascular disease to develop new forms of treatment and prevention.

“I am pleased that South Dakota State will receive this funding to continue conducting important heart and cardiovascular research,” Johnson said. “The universities in our state are at the forefront of research which helps South Dakota as well as the country. A key part of my Hometown Prosperity Plan is investing in the public good, and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment.”

HHS’s Cardiovascular Diseases Research Program funds research to increase prevention, education and the development of young scientists in the area of heart and vascular diseases.

The four pillars, or strategies, include "Promoting Partnerships," "Emphasizing Entrepreneurship," "Investing in the Public Good," and "Protecting Pocketbooks."
