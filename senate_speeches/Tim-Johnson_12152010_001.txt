Washington, DC — U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the South Dakota funding levels included in the upcoming year’s Omnibus spending bill. If passed, the bill would fund the federal government through Fiscal Year 2011 and provide resources for many South Dakota priorities, including Lewis and Clark, Mni Wiconi and South Dakota universities. 

“While I am not happy with all of these funding levels, this bill makes important investments in worthy South Dakota projects,” Johnson said. “It is part of my job to be an advocate for our state here in Congress, and that includes fighting for South Dakota priorities as part of the Appropriations process. These are tough budgetary times, but I hope we will move forward on this package to ensure that these projects don’t fall by the wayside.”   

The following includes the funds Johnson secured for South Dakota projects in the bill:
