Washington, DC — U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) released the following statement as the Senate prepares to vote later today on final passage of the President’s tax cut compromise:

“While I’m not happy with everything in this bill, I will support its passage because my number one priority has been ensuring that middle class families don’t see a huge tax increase on January 1st,” said Johnson. “I am pleased that this measure also includes an extension of emergency unemployment benefits, extends tax incentives for biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel and clears the way for small business growth.”

“At the end of the day, we have reached common ground on a politically-charged issue. We need more of this type of compromise on Capitol Hill, not less. The House will soon take up the measure, and I hope it reaches the President’s desk as quickly as possible,” concluded Johnson.
