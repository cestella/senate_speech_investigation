Washington, DC — U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today accepted a friendly wager from U.S. Senator Max Baucus (D-MT) on the University of Sioux Falls football championship game in Rome, Georgia on Saturday.

In a highly anticipated rematch, the University of Sioux Falls Cougars and the Carroll College Saints will play for the NAIA Championship.  This year’s game will take place Saturday, December 18th, 2010.

Sioux Falls has won the last two national titles and Baucus says it’s high time the trophy and bragging rights return to Helena. In favor of the Saints football team, Baucus is betting a case of Montana microbrew beer from Helena’s Lewis & Clark brewery against Johnson’s South Dakota buffalo steaks.

"I am looking forward to enjoying some of Montana’s best beer when the Cougars win the NAIA Championship title again this year,” said Johnson. “The University of Sioux Falls is an outstanding team, and I wish them the best as they prepare to take on the Carroll College football team later this week.”  

“The Carroll College football team is a great bunch of athletes and students and I’m looking forward to seeing them regain their status as NAIA National champs,” said Baucus, who grew up in Helena. “I’m also looking forward to enjoying some delicious South Dakota buffalo steak thanks to Senator Johnson.”

Carroll and the University of Sioux Falls have both been dominant figures in NAIA football in recent years and fans say this year’s matchup of the rivals has all the ingredients for “the perfect championship.”
