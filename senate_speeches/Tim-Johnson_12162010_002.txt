Washington, DC — U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) today encouraged South Dakota agriculture producers to visit their local Farm Service Agency (FSA) office to learn if they qualify for assistance under the Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments (SURE) Program. Passed as part of the 2008 Farm Bill, the disaster relief program compensates producers for crop losses incurred during the 2009 crop year. The application period begins on January 10, 2011.

“Many South Dakota producers suffered crop losses from natural disasters during the 2009 crop year. The SURE initiative was designed to provide comprehensive relief for our agricultural community. As producers begin to plan for the upcoming season, they should visit their local FSA office to learn more about this program,” said Johnson.

According to the United States Department of Agriculture, producers who have suffered at least a 10 percent production loss on a crop of economic significance are qualified to take part in the program, which entails obtaining crop insurance coverage. Producers must also meet the risk management purchase requirement and been physically located in a county that was declared a primary disaster county or contiguous county by the Agriculture Secretary under a Secretarial Disaster Designation. Without a Secretarial Disaster Designation, producers may qualify if the actual production is less than 50 percent of the normal production due to natural disaster.
