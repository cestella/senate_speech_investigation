Washington, DC — U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD), a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee, urged his colleagues in the Senate to confirm Joseph A. Smith to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) during the final days of this session of Congress.  Smith’s nomination cleared the Senate Banking Committee earlier this week.  Johnson said:

Joseph Smith’s nomination for Federal Housing Finance Agency received bipartisan support in the Banking Committee and from a range of regulatory, consumer and trade organizations.  Mr. Smith’s background as North Carolina’s Commissioner of Banks makes him uniquely qualified for this post with regulatory experience balancing the implementation of consumer protection with the importance of access to credit. 

As our economy and housing markets begin to recover, it is essential that the Federal Housing Finance Agency has a confirmed Director in place to ensure that qualified borrowers have access to mortgages and the housing recovery continues in a responsible way.  Joseph Smith has the background and experience to fill this role. 

The stability of the housing market is a top priority.  We need to put politics aside and confirm his nomination quickly so that FHFA has a leader at the helm given the many challenges facing our nation’s housing market.
