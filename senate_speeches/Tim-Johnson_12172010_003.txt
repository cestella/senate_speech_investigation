Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) has selected Tripp County as his December 2010 “County of the Month.” The county is highlighted in a special section of his website at http://johnson.senate.gov.

“Tripp County is an important part of South Dakota’s rich history,” Johnson said.  “I’m pleased this area has benefited from federal funding on several important projects, from the Mni Wiconi Rural Water System to the Rosebud Sioux Tribe Ambulance Service that serves this region.  I am also proud to see the positive effects the economic stimulus package is having in Tripp County, especially through energy efficiency improvements.”

Tripp County has much historical significance, and has recently celebrated its centennial.  It is home to many communities, including Winner, Colome, Hamill and Ideal. The vast prairie fields make the county a desirable location for hunters.

Johnson has worked hard to provide Tripp County with federal assistance, including funding for local emergency response units and local school districts.  Just this year alone, Johnson secured $27 million in federal funds for the Mni Wiconi Rural Water System, which will provide clean water service to more than 55,000 residents of South Dakota, including communities in Tripp County.

“I wanted to highlight one specific county each month to bring attention to our communities,” Johnson said.  “South Dakota communities deserve recognition for their accomplishments—they are truly great places to live.”
