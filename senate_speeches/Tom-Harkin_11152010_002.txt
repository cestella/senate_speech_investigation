Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) today announced that $7,090,000 will be coming to Iowa to expand broadband internet service in rural communities.  Specifically, the loan will go to the Interstate 35 Telephone Company, a small rural telephone company headquartered in Truro, to finance the construction of a fiber-to-the-premises system designed to serve all customers located in Interstate 35's three exchanges in Madison and Warren Counties.  When this project is complete, these rural subscribers will have an all-optic telecommunications system equal to that available in any urban area of the country and will be able to subscribe to extremely high speed broadband data service as well as digital video and voice services.

“In order for our rural businesses to stay competitive and our rural residents to be connected, it has become critical that they have access to broadband internet service,” said Harkin.  “I am pleased that today’s funding will help expand this necessary utility to more Iowans and I will continue to work in Washington to ensure our state continues to receive this kind of funding.”

Today’s funding is part of a $690 million nationwide investment from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program, which will finance over 16,000 miles of fiber to the home (FTTH), bringing high speed internet service to rural areas.  Harkin is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and the Appropriations subcommittee that funds USDA.
