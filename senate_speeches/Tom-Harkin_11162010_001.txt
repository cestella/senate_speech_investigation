Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) was on hand to congratulate Army Staff Sargent Salvatore Giunta of Hiawatha today as President Obama awarded him the Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest military award.  Sgt. Giunta is the first living recipient of the Medal of Honor who served in any war since Vietnam.
 
“On an Afghan battlefield in the middle of the night, Iowa’s own Sargent Giunta demonstrated the bravery and resolve that lie at the heart of the American spirit,” Harkin said.  “In the midst of an ambush, Giunta charged directly at Taliban fighters, risking his own life to save three wounded compatriots.  
 
“At a time when America is tried by war and recession, Sgt. Giunta’s story reminds us of what is best about our country.  His actions speak to the mettle of our character – to our loyalty, determination and courage.
 
“Congratulations to Sargent Giunta on this well-deserved honor, which is unprecedented in recent history.  America, and especially the state of Iowa, have a right to be very proud.”
