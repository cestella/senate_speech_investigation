Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) and a Senate leader on disability issues, today released the following statement celebrating the 35th anniversary of The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA):

“Today, we celebrate a tremendously important and successful law.  But, more fundamentally, we are celebrating a simple but radical idea: the idea that every child can benefit from an education, and has a right to a free and appropriate public education that is guaranteed by our nation’s Constitution. 

“But our job is by no means complete.  In the years ahead, we must redouble our focus on high expectations for students with disabilities.  We must ensure that the post-high school reality for students with disabilities includes opportunities for higher education. 

“Our focus on students with disabilities cannot end when they complete school. We must build pathways into the workforce – with real opportunities for competitive, integrated employment, with decent wages and benefits, for all young people with disabilities. 

“It bears remembering that, prior to 1975, children in the United States with intellectual disabilities, physical disabilities and even sensory disabilities were not guaranteed access to a public education.  Today, in America, we recognize that people with disabilities – like all people – have unique abilities, talents, and aptitudes.  And that America is better, fairer, and richer when we make full use of those gifts.”
