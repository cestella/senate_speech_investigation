Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) today announced that a total of $8,314,718 in federal grants are coming to Iowa from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The funding will be used for disaster mitigation projects, which are aimed at reducing the amount of damage caused by future disasters.

“Even though Iowa has seen more than its fair share of natural disasters in recent years, our state is resilient and will continue to rebuild,” said Harkin. “Today’s funding will help safeguard our citizens and infrastructure from future disasters.”

This FEMA disaster mitigation program is administered by the Iowa Homeland Security and Emergency Management Division, which identifies and manages the projects from beginning to end.  The objectives of the program are to reduce or eliminate future risk to lives and property from all hazards, provide funds to implement projects previously identified in state or local hazard mitigation plans and enable mitigation measures to be implemented during the immediate recovery from a disaster.  Funding is allocated to Iowa on the basis of the cost of FEMA assistance from past disasters.

Specific federal project funding includes:

Butler County Rural Electric Cooperative - $4,074,184 – to retrofit and strengthen 71.78 miles of electric distribution lines in four counties, Bremer, Butler, Chickasaw and Floyd.

Mason City High School/John Adams Middle School - $1,891,254 – to build a multipurpose safe room within a new addition to the John Adams Middle School/High School Building.

City of Eagle Grove (Wright County) - $2,349,280 – to increase the capacity of the existing overland storm sewer channel and to reduce infiltration of storm water into the septic sewer lines.
