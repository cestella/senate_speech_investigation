As part of his continuing support for Iowa’s Community Health Centers, Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) today announced that the Iowa Nebraska Primary Care Association will receive $75,000 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).   The funding, which will  be used to provide for additional training and technical assistance at all of Iowa’s community health centers, was made available by the Affordable Care Act, historic health reform legislation that was signed into law earlier this year.  As Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, Harkin played a pivotal role in the Senate passage of the new law.  He also serves as chair of the Senate panel that funds health initiatives.

“Community health centers play a critical role in Iowa, providing health care for thousands who lack adequate health insurance,” said Harkin.  “These funds will help to ensure that all Iowans get the quality, affordable health care they need.”

Harkin has been an ardent supporter of Iowa’s 13 federally-funded community health centers and has obtained funds for the facilities’ construction, equipment purchases, and dental expansions through his work on the Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations subcommittee.
