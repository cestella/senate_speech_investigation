 Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) today announced that $500,000 will be coming to Iowa to improve safety by upgrading technology on Iowa’s railways.  The funding comes from the Federal Railroad Administration’s Railroad Safety Technology Program, and was provided for in the Fiscal Year 2010 Appropriations bill.  Harkin is a senior member of the Appropriations subcommittee that funds transportation initiatives. 

“The safe transport of goods, services and passengers helps keep our economy moving,” Harkin said.  “Today’s funding will help make key safety improvements to Iowa’s railways, helping our state maintain a crucial freight and passenger rail transportation system.”

The Westinghouse Airbrake Corporation, a company with offices in Cedar Rapids, will receive $500,000 to move Iowa’s railways towards compliance with the 2008 Rail Safety Improvement Act, which requires that major improvements in safety and technology be made to America’s railways by 2015.  Specifically, the funding will be used for improved Positive Train Control (PTC) track database verification and validation.  The project will provide the ability to use ordinary video currently collected in a locomotive to run through a subdivision to validate PTC Track Database Survey location points.
