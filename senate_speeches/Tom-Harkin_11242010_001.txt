Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) today announced that $12,348 will be coming to the Iowa City Fire Department and $36,072 will be coming to the Primghar Fire Department through the Federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program.  The purpose of the AFG is to award grants directly to fire departments and EMS organizations that are unaffiliated with a hospital to enhance their ability to protect the health and safety of the public, as well as that of first-responder personnel.  The funds can be used for training, equipment, personal protective equipment, wellness and fitness and health and safety modifications to stations and facilities.

“Ensuring that our first responders have the equipment and training to protect people and communities should be a top priority and today’s funding will help do just that,”  said Harkin.  “I am pleased that the fire departments in Iowa City and Primghar are receiving this funding and I will work in Washington to ensure that our state continues to receive funding to keep Iowans safe.”

Today’s AFG grants are made available by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency in cooperation with the U.S. Fire Administration.  The program is an important component of the larger, coordinated effort to strengthen the Nation’s overall level of preparedness and ability to respond to fire and related hazards.  Harkin is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee that funds the Department of Homeland Security.
