Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) today announced that the National Agricultural-based Lubricant (NABL) Center at the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar falls has received $371,373 to study the feasibility of using biodegradable grease and hydraulic fluids for freight and passenger railroad locomotives.  This funding was provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Federal Railroad Administration.  Harkin is a senior member of the Senate committee that funds transportation initiatives. 

“I have had the opportunity to visit the NABL Center many times and am excited to see how this research will help modernize our transportation system,” said Harkin.  “Funding for this study will lead to less reliance on imported petroleum, environmentally benign lubricants that are nontoxic to rail workers and more jobs especially in Iowa and areas where soybeans are grown and processed."

Specifically, the study will:

conduct  an analysis of the potential use of soy-based grease and hydraulic fluids to perform according to railroad industry standards;
conduct an analysis of the potential use of other readily biodegradable lubricants and greases to perform to railroad industry standards;
compare the health and safety of petroleum-based lubricants with readily biodegradable lubricants and greases;
compare the environmental impact of petroleum-based lubricants with readily biodegradable lubricants and greases;
compare the performance of the readily biodegradable lubricant and grease in comparison to petroleum-based lubricants; and
study the effects of the readily biodegradable lubricants and greases on railroad equipment components in comparison to petroleum-based lubricants.
