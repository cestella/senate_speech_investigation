WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Tom Udall today announced that several arts organizations in New Mexico will receive a total of $232,500 in matching grants to support the creation and presentation of artistically excellent works to the public. These grants are funded through the National Endowment for the Arts.

"This is welcome support for artists and producers in New Mexico," said Udall, a member of the Senate Cultural Caucus. "These matching grants will promote local artists and expose our communities to valuable productions and works that both inspire and enrich our lives."

In this first round of grants in the new fiscal year, The National Endowment for the Arts has awarded more than $24 million to more than 850 organizations across the country. These grants generate, on average, $7 from non-federal sources for each dollar awarded.
