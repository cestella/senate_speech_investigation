WASHINGTON - U.S. Senators Tom Udall and Jeff Bingaman announced that three bills focusing on Native American priorities in New Mexico were approved today by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.

Udall, a member of the Indian Affairs Committee, facilitated consideration of the legislation by his committee colleagues. All three bills were approved by voice votes, and are now ready for consideration by the full Senate.

The bills are:

	S. 3903, which would grant Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo authority to enter into leases of up to 99 years for lands held in trust for the pueblo. This authority would increase the ability of the pueblo to attract businesses to tribal lands, and expand tribal self-determination. Udall and Bingaman introduced this bill earlier this year. Under current law, leases may extend for a maximum of 25 years. A longer lease term would give the pueblo additional flexibility to work with businesses that require a land lease to have a presence in the area.

	H.R. 4445, The Indian Pueblo Cultural Center Clarification Act, would repeal the 1978 restriction that prohibited land being held in trust by the All Indian Pueblo Council for the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center from being considered "Indian Land."

	H.R. 5811, which would amend the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama and Coushatta Indian Tribes of Texas Restoration Act to allow the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo Tribe to determine the blood quantum requirement for membership in the tribe. The original bill includes a 1/8th blood quantum requirement for membership of both tribes. This bill would revoke that requirement and allow the Pueblo of Ysleta del Sur to determine membership, as is the standard among the other federally-recognized tribes.

"These bills will help New Mexico's pueblos expand their self-determination, while providing them with additional resources to continue building their economies, create good jobs for residents, and improve the quality of life across Indian Country," Udall said. "I was proud to introduce the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo legislation with Senator Bingaman and to lend my support to these two other important bills. I look forward to their quick consideration and passage by the full Senate."

"I'd like to thank Senator Udall for ushering these bills through the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. This legislation supports key efforts in Indian Country that benefit pueblo members and enhance economic development opportunities," Bingaman said.
