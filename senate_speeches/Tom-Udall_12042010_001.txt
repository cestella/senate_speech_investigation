WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) released the following statement today after Republicans in the Senate blocked passage of critical legislation that would have extended tax cuts for middle class Americans - including 98 percent of New Mexicans:

"Today, Democrats offered two versions of legislation that would have permanently extended the Bush-era tax cuts for hardworking Americans. But while Democrats fought to protect middle class families, Republicans continued to hold these tax cuts hostage - siding once again with millionaires and billionaires instead of protecting the interests of our small businesses and hardworking Americans. Democrats were even willing to compromise by proposing a tax cut extension for Americans making up to $1 million a year, but Republicans refused to bend - holding out for giveaways for millionaires and billionaires.

"The reality is that a tax break for millionaires and billionaires would add at least $700 billion to the deficit. In these tough economic times, New Mexico families continue to struggle to make ends meet and provide for their families. I was sent to Washington by the people of New Mexico to get things done, to help grow our economy and to create good jobs for hardworking Americans. That's what I fight for every day. Today's vote clearly illustrates who supports middle class New Mexicans and Americans, and who doesn't."
