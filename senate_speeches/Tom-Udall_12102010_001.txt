WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Tom Udall today announced that the Navajo Transit System, Ohkay Owingeh and the Pueblos of Santa Ana, San Ildefonso and Tesuque will receive a total of $1,139,667 to enhance their public transportation systems.

Funding will be provided through the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Transit Administration and will be used for operating costs and expansion of services including new buses, bus shelters and seven additional routes.

"It is important to invest in our public transportation systems, especially in these rural areas of New Mexico where so many people rely on these systems to get to work, the doctor or even to get groceries," Udall said.
