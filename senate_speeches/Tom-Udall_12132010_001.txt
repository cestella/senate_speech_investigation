WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Tom Udall, (D-NM) released the following statement today on his vote to invoke cloture on the president's proposed tax measure:

"Today, I voted to move the Senate forward to a straight up or down vote on this tax proposal. While I still have serious concerns with the package, there has been adequate time to study it and now we must do our jobs and vote. I have continually fought against obstruction and needless delay in the Senate and refuse to contribute to our dysfunction by voting to delay further this bill's consideration."
