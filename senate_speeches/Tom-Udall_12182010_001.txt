WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) released the following statement today following the Senate's passage of legislation to repeal "Don't ask, don't tell."

"As Barry Goldwater used to say, ‘You don't have to be straight to shoot straight,' and I couldn't agree more. Since ‘Don't ask don't tell' was instituted more than 14,000 men and women who pledged their lives for this country were discharged.

"A clear majority of the American people and our military leadership agree that repealing the policy is the right thing to do. I am proud the Senate agrees and voted to end this unjust policy today."
