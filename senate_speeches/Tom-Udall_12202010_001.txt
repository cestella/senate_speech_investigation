WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) announced that Cerrillos Hills State Park was awarded $782,910.88 from the National Park Service to build needed support facilities such as a visitors center and a maintenance building.

"This funding will allow Cerrillos Hills State Park to offer expanded services to New Mexicans and visitors from across the country who are interested in the many opportunities for year-round hiking, horseback riding and mountain biking that the park has to offer," Udall said. "Building this new visitors center will help the village of Cerillos further highlight the beautiful views of the Sandia, Ortiz, Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountain ranges and spur economic growth in the community."

The visitors center will be located in the village of Cerrillos and will provide an orientation for visitors and a brief history of the area, including an overview of the more than 1,100 years of mining history in the area.
